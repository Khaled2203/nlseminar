We will present the results of the 2003 Johns Hopkins University
Summer Workshop on "Syntax for Statistical Machine Translation".

We will describe a large effort to extend a high-performing
phrase-based MT system as baseline by adding new features representing
syntactic knowledge that deal with specific problems of the underlying
baseline. We investigate a broad range of possible feature functions,
from very simple binary features to sophisticated tree-to-tree
translation models. Simple feature functions test if a certain
constituent occurs in the source and the target language parse
tree. More sophisticated features will be derived from an alignment
model where whole sub-trees in source and target can be aligned node
by node. We present results on the Chinese-English large data track of
the recent TIDES MT evaluations.

This is joint work with the other workshop team members: Daniel
Gildea, Anoop Sarkar, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Kenji Yamada, Libin Shen,
Shankar Kumar, David Smith, Viran Jain, Katherine Eng, Jin Zhen and
Dragomir Radev.
