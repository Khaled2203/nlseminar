Coping with Surprise: The Case of Cebuano
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm

For ten days in March, nine research teams worked together to build
Cebuano language resources and systems for a "dry run" the TIDES Suprise
Language experiment. Cebuano is spoken widely in the southern
Phillipines, but there had previously been little work on computational
linguistics for that language. As we prepare for the actual Suprise
Language experiment this June, we will use this talk to look back on what
worked, what didn't, and what lessons there are to be learned from our
experience in March. Come prepared to share the excitement, offer your
ideas, and understand why we have tried to ask Ed to cancel all vacations
during the month of June (just kidding...).
