I will give a status report on my current thesis work on
noun phrase translation. The motivation of this work is
to break up the machine translation problem into smaller,
more manageable units. The treatment of noun phrase translation
as a subtask of machine translation is both linguistically
and empirically motivated. My approach is to generate 
a n-best list of candidate translations with a statistical 
machine translation system and rerank the candidates with
additional features. For about 90% of all noun phrases we
can find an acceptable translation in the 100-best list, while 
an acceptable translation comes out on the very top for only 
about 60% of the noun phrases. I will discuss a variety of 
linguistic and empirical features that (may) help to move 
the acceptable translations higher in the list. I will also
present results modeling issues such as phrase based 
translation and compound splitting. This talk is also 
intended as a fishing expedition for feature suggestions by
the audience.
