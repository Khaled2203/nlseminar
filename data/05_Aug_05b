The Family of Prague Dependency Treebanks

The Prague Dependency Treebank project is aimed at a linguistically
complex, multi-tier annotation of relatively large amounts of naturally
occuring sentences of natural language. There are four tiers at present:
the basic token tier (level 0), and the morphological, surface-syntacic,
and semantic (called "tectogrammatics") tiers. The syntactic and
tectogrammatic tiers are based on a richly labelled dependency
representation principle. So far, the project produced three corpora: the
Czech-language-only Prague Dependency Treebank, the Prague Czech-English
Dependency Treebank and the Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank. In the
talk, the principles of the Prague Dependency Treebank linguistic
annotation scheme will be presented. Some technical details will also be
discussed, as well as some of the tools developed both for the manual
annotation itself and for corpus-based NLP of Czech, English and Arabic.
