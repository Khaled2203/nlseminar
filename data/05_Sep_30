This paper investigates some computational problems associated with
probabilistic translation models that have recently been adopted in the
literature on machine translation. These models can be viewed as pairs of
probabilistic context-free grammars working in a `synchronous' way. Two
hardness results for the class NP are reported, along with an exponential
time lower-bound for certain classes of algorithms that are currently used
in the literature.
