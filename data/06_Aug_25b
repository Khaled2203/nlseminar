Inflected languages in a low-resource setting present a data sparsity problem for
statistical machine translation. In this work, we present a minimally  
supervised algorithm for morpheme segmentation on Arabic dialects  
which reduces unknown words at translation time by over 50%, total  
vocabulary size by over 40%, and yields a significant increase in  
BLEU score over a previous state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical MT system.
