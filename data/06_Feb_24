I present an algorithm, Searn (for "search-learn") that is designed to
solve structured prediction problem: problems whose goal is to learn to
predict complex objects such as parts-of-speech, parse trees,
translations, etc...  Searn functions by "breaking apart" structured
prediction problems into classification problems in the process of search.  
I analyze Searn in the framework of learning reductions and show that good
performance on the underlying classification problems implies good search
performance.  Moreover, Searn is computationally efficient in a superset
of the settings where previous algorithms are efficient and is not limited
by conditional independence assumptions (as in CRFs).  This excessively
simple and general algorithm turns out to have excellent state-of-the-art
performance.

This is joint work with John Langford (TTI-C) and Daniel Marcu; and, to a
lesser extent, with Drew Bagnell (CMU) and Bianca Zadrozny (IBM TJ
Watson).
