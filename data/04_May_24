Challenges in Statistical Machine Translation

In the last years a standard model in statistical machine
translation has emerged, which is based on the translation
of sequences of words (so-called "phrases") at a time.
I will describe this model, how to train and decode with it,
but the focus of this talk will be how to address the
challenges to advance and move beyond the model: my thesis
work on noun phrase translation, making use of syntax, and
better modeling, such as discriminative training.

Bio: Philipp Koehn is the author of papers on natural language
processing, machine translation, and machine learning. He
received his PhD from the University of Southern California
in 2003 (advisor: Kevin Knight), and is currently employed as
a postdoc at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working
with Michael Collins. He has worked at AT&T Laboratories on
text-to-speech systems, and at WhizBang! Labs on text
categorization.
