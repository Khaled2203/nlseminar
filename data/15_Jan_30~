The highly complex structure of the human brain is strongly shaped by genetic influences. Subcortical brain regions act jointly with cortical areas to coordinate movement, memory, motivation, reinforcement and learning. To investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and intracranial volume, derived from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of 30,717 individuals. By identifying genetic influences on brain structure, we can begin to map the genetic architecture underlying variability in human brain development and function, a process that will help elucidate the dysfunctions that lie at the core of neuropsychiatric disorders. 

Bio: Derrek Hibar is an assistant professor in the Department of Neurology in the Keck School of Medicine of USC where he studies common genetic influences on brain structure and susceptibility to psychiatric disorders. He is currently coordinating one of the largest studies of brain structure to date as part of the ENIGMA Consortium (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu).
