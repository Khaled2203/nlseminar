Solutions for many natural language processing problems such as speech recognition, transliteration, and  translation have been described as weighted finite-state transducer cascades. The transducer formalism is very useful for researchers, not only for its ability to expose the deep similarities between seemingly disparate models, but also because expressing models in this formalism allows for rapid implementation of real, data-driven systems. Finite-state toolkits can interpret and process transducer chains using generic algorithms and many real-world systems have been built using these toolkits. Current research in NLP makes use of syntax-rich models that are poorly suited to extant transducer toolkits, which process linear input and output. Tree transducers can handle these models, and a weighted tree transducer toolkit with appropriate generic algorithms will lead to the sort of gains in syntax-based modeling that were achieved with string transducer toolkits. In this thesis proposal practice talk I will briefly trace the history of finite-state transducers and automata as they relate to natural language processing and the evolution of formalisms and the toolkits that support them, leading up to motivation for the design and creation of Tiburon, the toolkit referenced in this talk's title. I will describe previous, current, and future work on Tiburon's algorithms and the effectiveness of both algorithms and  software at cleanly representing syntax-based NLP models from the literature and at constructing and evaluating novel models.
