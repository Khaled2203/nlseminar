If you speak a little perl, are an occasional perl-scripter, and  
would like to know more about how to use it as a (p)ortable, (e)
fficient, and (r)eadible (l)anguage, you may be interested in my  
brown bag (read: bring your own) lunch seminar:

I will talk about using Perl in a portable fashion, the environment  
it is run in, and how avoid common mistakes and misconceptions. Perl  
offers more than a thousand ways to solve a problem, but some are  
more portable or more efficient than others. If time permits, simple  
hands-on examples can be tried out during the talk, so power for  
laptops will be provided.
