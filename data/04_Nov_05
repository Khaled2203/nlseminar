The ABC (Assess by Computer) system has been developed and used in the
School of Computer Science at the University of Manchester for formative
and (principally) summative assessment at undergraduate and postgraduate
level. We believe that fully automatic marking of constructed answers -
especially free text answers - is not a sensible aim. Instead - drawing on
parallels in the history of machine translation - we take a
"human-computer collaborative" approach, in which the system does what it
can to support the efficiency and consistency of the human marker, who
keeps the final judgement.

Our current work focuses on what are generally referred to as "short text
answers" as contrasted to "essays". However we prefer to contrast
"factual" with "discursive" answers, and speculate that the former may be
amenable to simple statistical techniques, while the latter require more
sophisticated natural language analysis. I will show some examples of real
exam data and the techniques we are using and developing to handle them.
