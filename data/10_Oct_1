Automatic Analysis of Rhythmic Poetry with Applications to Generation and Translation (EMNLP 2010 Practice Talk)

We employ statistical methods to analyze, generate, and translate rhythmic poetry. We first apply unsupervised learning to reveal word-stress patterns in a corpus of raw poetry. We then use these word-stress patterns, in addition to rhyme and discourse models, to generate English love poetry. Finally, we translate Italian poetry into English, choosing target realizations that conform to desired rhythmic patterns.
