Noisy word alignments negatively affect the quality of the translation 
rules extracted by the ISI syntax-based MT system.  In the literature, 
alignment is typically treated as a separate process from subsequent 
stages in the MT pipeline.  By contrast, we allow rule extraction to 
guide the alignment process.

We present an unsupervised algorithm for identifying and removing "bad" 
links using GHKM syntax-based rule extraction.  We show that
we can improve upon the precision of GIZA union (measured against a gold 
standard set of manually aligned Chinese-English sentence pairs),
while only decreasing recall slightly.
