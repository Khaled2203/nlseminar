Speech is a crucial component in human computer interaction. While
tremendous progress has been made in automatic speech recognition, speech
transcription -- which is the output of automatic speech recognition -- is
far from providing all the information that one could retrieve from
speech. For example, prominence, pause, rhythm, and rate of speech all
carry important information in speech and are crucial in speech
perception. Inclusion of such information can facilitate better machine
recognition and understanding of speech.

In this talk, we will introduce the research effort and result in speech
rate, prominence, disfluency and utterance boundary detection. We will
also show some interesting applications utilizing these features in
natural language understanding and dialog management.
