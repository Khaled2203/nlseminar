The medieval Voynich Manuscript has been called "the most 
mysterious document in the world".  Its pages contain bizarre drawings 
of strange plants and astrological diagrams, as well as an undeciphered 
script of 20,000 running words, written in a character set that has never 
been seen elsewhere.  Its origin is also controversial, with many theories 
abounding.  I will describe the document, show samples, explain where it 
may have come from, and present some properties of the text. 

This will more of a history/mystery talk than 
a computer science talk.
