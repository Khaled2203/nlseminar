Statistical MT with Bilingual Morphology

Traditional statistical MT systems mostly work on the word-
andphrase-level. For different language pairs, the performance of such
systems vary from some 15% to 35%. These systems suffer from problems
such as sparse data, with huge vocabulary sizes leading to less
reliable probability estimates. In our current research, we aim to
come up with a better MT system by looking inside the words. Almost in
every language, a root (stem) can have many different forms
(inflectional, derivational, etc.). If we can identify the roots, the
size of the vocabulary will quite small, and we can have better
probability estimates, reducing the sparse data problem and
potentially leading to higher accuracy. We are trying to come up with
a model that induces morphology automatically from a bilingual corpus
and achieves this improvement.
