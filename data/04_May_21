<b>Natural Language Understanding: A fast and accurate Statistical Learning Approach for Dialogue Systems</b>

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is an essential module of a good
dialogue system. To achieve satisfactory performance levels, real time
dialogue systems need the NLU module to be both fast and accurate. Finite
State Model (FSM) based systems are fast and accurate but lack robustness
and flexibility. The Statistical Learning Model (SLM) based systems are
robust and flexible but lack accuracy and are at most times slow.

In this talk, I am going to talk about an SLM based NLU approach for
dialogue utterances that is both accurate and fast. The system has high
accuracy and produces frames in real time.

<b>A Community of Words: Understanding Social Relationships from E-mail</b>

A corpus of e-mail messages presents a number of challenges for NLP
techniques, with its nearly unconstrained structure and vocabulary,
mistyped words and ungrammatical sentences, and extensive contextual
information that is never explicitly stated. Yet, the intrinsically social
nature of such communication provides an opportunity to study not just a
bag of words, but also the relationships, competencies, and activities
behind them.

This talk presents work with Eduard Hovy as part of the MKIDS project.
