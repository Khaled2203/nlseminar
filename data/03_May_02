We present an approach to automatically extracting paraphrase templates
from document/abstract pairs. This methodology relies on word-based
alignments created by off-the-shelf software. Our paraphrases are
evaluated by human evaluators for precision and automatically for
applicability. We find that 77% of the extracted paraphrases are judged
to be always correct and that the generalized templates of 60% are
judged to be applicable most of the time and 87% are judged to be
applicable sometimes.
