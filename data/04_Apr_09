An interesting (disturbing?) new trend is beginning to manifest itself in
NLP, one that is focused on performance and hence very attractive in the
context of inter-system competitive evaluations such as TREC and DUC, but
one that does not provide much insight about language or NLP methods to
the researcher interested in these topics.  This addition of a new
paradigm to NLP has implications for all of us.
