Nonparametric Bayesian Word Sense Induction (ACL practice talk)

We propose the use of a nonparametric Bayesian model, the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), for the task of Word Sense Induction. Results are
shown through comparison against Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a parametric Bayesian model employed by Brody and Lapata (2009) for this task.
We find that the two models achieve similar levels of induction quality, while the HDP confers the advantage of automatically inducing a variable number of senses per word, as compared to manually fixing the number of senses a priori, as in LDA. This flexibility allows for the model to adapt to terms with greater or lesser polysemy, when evidenced by corpus distributional statistics.
