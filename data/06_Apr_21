In this talk, we introduce a methodology for analyzing judgment opinions.
We define a judgment opinion as consisting of a valence, a holder, and a
topic. We decompose the task of opinion analysis into four parts: 1)
recognizing the opinion; 2) identifying the valence; 3)  identifying the
holder; and 4) identifying the topic. We evaluate our methodology using
both intrinsic and extrinsic measures.
