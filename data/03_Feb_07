I will give a status report work on information extraction during last
10 months. The motivation of this work is to learn extraction
patterns automatically using seed template and web search engine. My
approach is to generate linguistics patterns and surface patterns and
combine them to compenstate for the respective weaknesses of two
patterns. On the DUC01-test-disasters (67 documents),
DUC01-training-disasters (54 documents) I got a 0.34/0.26 f-measure
respectively. In this talk, I will give a status report on ReAD
project (with Dr. Chin-Yew Lin).
