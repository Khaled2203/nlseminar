Psychiatric document retrieval attempts to help people to efficiently
and effectively locate the consultation documents relevant to their
depressive problems. Individuals can understand how to alleviate their
symptoms according to recommendations in the relevant documents. This
work proposes the use of high-level topic information extracted from
consultation documents to improve the precision of retrieval
results. The topic information adopted herein includes negative life
events, depressive symptoms and semantic relations between symptoms,
which are beneficial for better understanding of users'
queries. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves
higher precision than the word-based retrieval models, namely the
vector space model (VSM) and Okapi model, adopting word-level
information alone.
