The research of extracting event duration information from texts is 
potentially very important in applications in which the time course of 
events is to be extracted from news.  For example, whether two events 
overlap or are in sequence often depends very much on their durations.  If 
a war started yesterday, we can be pretty sure it is still going on today. 
If a hurricane started last year, we can be sure it is over by now.

In the talk, I will first present our work on constructing an annotated 
corpus for extracting information about the typical durations of events 
from texts, including the annotation guidelines, the event classes we 
categorized, the way we use normal distributions to model such vague and 
implicit temporal information, and how we evaluate inter-annotator 
agreement. I will then show that machine learning techniques applied to 
this data yield coarse-grained event duration information, considerably 
outperforming a baseline and approaching human performance.

At the beginning of the talk, I will also give a brief overview of the 
time ontology (OWL-Time, formerly DAML-Time) we have developed, which is 
represented in both first-order logic and the OWL web ontology language.
