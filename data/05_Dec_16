A Better N-Best List - Practical Determinization of Weighted Finite Tree Automata

Ranked lists of output trees from syntactic statistical NLP applications
frequently contain multiple repeated entries. This redundancy leads to
misrepresentation of tree weight and reduced information for debugging and
tuning purposes. It is chiefly due to nondeterminism in the weighted
automata that produce the results. I will introduce an algorithm that
determinizes such automata while preserving proper weights, returning the
sum of the weight of all multiply derived trees. I will also report
results of the application of the algorithm to machine translation and
Data Oriented Parsing.
