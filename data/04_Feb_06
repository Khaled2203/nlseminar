What's in a Translation Rule?

We propose a theory that gives formal semantics to word-level
alignments defined over parallel corpora. We use our theory to
introduce a linear algorithm that can be used to derive from
word-aligned, parallel corpora the minimal set of syntactically
motivated transformation rules that explain human translation data.
