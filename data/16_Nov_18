Incremental spoken dialogue system for reference resolution in images
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

In this talk, I will be speaking about our ongoing effort in the
development of Eve, state-of-the-art incremental reference resolution
in images based spoken dialogue agent. Incrementality is central to
developing a naturally conversing spoken dialogue systems.
Incrementality makes the conversations more natural and efficient
compared to non-incremental alternatives. The performance of the Eve
was found to be comparable to human performance and she conveniently
outperforms alternative non-incremental architectures. However,
building such a system is not trivial. It needs high-performance
architectures and dialogue components (ASR, dialogue policies,
language understanding etc.). I will also speak about future plans for
enhancing Eve's capability. I also take a slight deviation and explore
a different word level natural language understanding model for
reference resolution in images in a dialogue setting.

Bio: Ramesh Manuvinakurike is a Ph.D. student at USC Institute for
Creative Technologies working with Prof. David DeVault and Prof.
Kallirroi Georgila. He is interested in developing conversational
systems and has developed various such systems. His work with his
colleagues on agent Eve won 'Best paper' award at Sigdial 2015.
