(note: this is a very tentative title -- comments welcome!)

We present a novel extension of syntax-directed translation for
statistical MT. Formally speaking, our model is based on tree-to- string
transducers that recursively convert a parse-tree in the source-language
into a string in the target-language. These transduction rules have
multi-level trees on the source-side, giving this system more
transformational power due to the extended domain of locality. We also
present efficient algorithms for decoding based on dynamic programming.
Initial experiments on English-to-Chinese translation show promising
results in both speed and the translation quality.

Joint work with Kevin Knight and Aravind Joshi.

Bio:

Liang Huang is a 3rd-year PhD student from the University of Pennsylvania.
He is mainly interested in algorithms and formalisms for parsing and
syntax-based machine translation. His recent work has been on k-best
parsing algorithms (with David Chiang) and synchronous binarization for MT
(with Hao Zhang, Dan Gildea, and Kevin Knight).
