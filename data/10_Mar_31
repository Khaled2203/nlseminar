Lattice and Forest for SMT

Statistical machine translation (SMT) has witnessed promising progress in recent years. Typically, an SMT system is characterized as a single-best pipeline, whose modules are independent to each other and only take as input single-best results from the previous module. With this assumption, each module will inevitably introduce errors in single-best outputs, which will propagate and accumulate along the pipeline, and eventually hurt the translation quality.

 
In order to alleviate this problem, we use compact structures such as lattices and forests instead of single-best results in each module, and then integrate both lattice and forest into a single tree-to-string system. We explore the algorithms of lattice parsing, lattice-forest-based rule extraction and decoding. Experiments show a statistically significant improvement over a start-of-the-art forest-based baseline. More interestingly, we observe a significant reduction in rule-set size when extracting with a lattice, which implies better generalizability (with a smaller model).
