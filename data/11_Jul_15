We offer a simple, effective, and scalable method for statistical
machine translation parameter tuning based on the pairwise approach to
ranking. Unlike the popular MERT algorithm, our pairwise ranking
optimization (PRO) method is not limited to a handful of parameters
and can easily handle systems with thousands of features. Moreover,
unlike recent approaches built upon the MIRA algorithm of Crammer and
Singer, PRO is easy to implement. It uses off-the-shelf linear binary
classifier software and can be built on top of an existing MERT
framework in a matter of hours. We establish PRO's scalability and
effectiveness by comparing it to MERT and MIRA and demonstrate parity
on both phrase-based and syntax-based systems in a variety of language
pairs, using large scale data scenarios.
