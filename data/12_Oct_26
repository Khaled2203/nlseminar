Computer Aided Translation
3:00 am - 4:00 pm
10th Floor Conference Room [1026]

comes to high quality publishable translation, human translators
are still unchallenged. Since we can't beat them, can we help
them to become more productive? I will talk about some recent
work on developing assistance tools for human translators.
