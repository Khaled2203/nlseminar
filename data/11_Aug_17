Structured Language Modelling for Machine Translation
2:00 pm - 2:30 pm
4th Floor Large Conference Room [460]

Machine translation can potentially benefit from the guidance of a
language model that evaluates translation candidates based on syntactic
structures. In this talk we are going to describe the summer project to
build such an incremental structured language model that can be used in
machine translation systems that generate the target language in a
left-to-right manner. We will describe in detail our work in modelling,
search, and parameter smoothing.
