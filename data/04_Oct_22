Like Now:  Two Explorations in Deep Lexical Semantics

As part of an effort to encode the commonsense knowledge we need in
natural language understanding, I have been looking at several very common
words and their uses in diverse corpora, and asking what we have to know
to understand this word in this context.  In this talk, I will describe
the investigations of the uses of two words -- the adverb "now" and the
preposition "like".

One might think that "now" simply expresses a temporal property of an
event.  But in fact in almost every instance, it is used to point up a
contrast -- "This is true now.  Something else was true then."  It is thus
more of a relation than a property.  I will describe several categories of
such relations.  Another question of interest about "now" is "How long a
period is the word "now" describing in its various uses?": "I'm typing an
abstract now" vs. "We travel by automobile now."  I suggest some
categories of knowledge that need to be encoded to answer this question.

When we successfully understand "A is like B", we have figured out some
property that A and B have in common.  How can we find that property
computationally?  In the data I looked at, in 80% of the instances, the
property is explicit in the nearby text, and I will talk about how we can
identify it.  For the remainder I examine the knowledge we would need in
order to infer the common property.
