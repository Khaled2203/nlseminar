The Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) of \cite{DekaiCL} generates a
synchronous parse tree for a given pair of sentences in two languages. By
allowing inversion of the order of children at any level of the
synchronous parse tree, ITG can do recursive, systematic word reordering.
We made a version of ITG where the nonterminals are lexicalized by word
pairs and the inversions are dependent on the so-lexicalized nonterminals.  
We found out that after lexicalization, the Alignment Error Rate (AER)
against gold standard is reduced for short sentences. ITG parsing
complexity is high polynomial. We proposed a pruning techique that
utilizes IBM Model 1 to estimate the inside and outside probability of a
bitext cell. Taking a step further, we applied the A* parsing having been
used for monolingual parsing to ITG.  I will talk about the heuristic
estimates we used for A* parsing for Viterbi alignment selection and
decoding.
