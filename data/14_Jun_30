Abstract: We consider the challenge of learning semantic parsers that scale to large, open-domain problems, such as question answering or knowledge base completion with Freebase. In such settings, the sentences cover a wide variety of topics and include many phrases whose meaning is difficult to represent in a fixed target ontology. For example, even simple phrases such as `daughter' and `number of people living in' cannot be directly represented in Freebase, whose ontology instead encodes facts about gender, parenthood, and population. Here, we introduce a semantic parsing approach that learns to resolve such ontological mismatches. The parser uses a probabilistic CCG to build linguistically motivated logical-form meaning representations, and includes an ontology matching model that adapts the output logical forms for each target ontology.
