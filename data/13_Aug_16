Gully Burns (USC/ISI)
Bridging Between Bioinformatics and Natural Language Processing
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

The Mouse Genome Informatics database (MGI) has participated extensively in shared NLP challenges focussed on developing infrastructure for their use. This collaboration has advanced the field of applying NLP to biomedical text but has not yet generated workable technology for use in the lab. In advance of a workshop (Monday August 19, 2013 at ISI) dedicated to this subject, I will describe the SciKnowMine project to introduce the domain of biomedical NLP and to showcase how we can collaboratively accelerate the process of biocuration, making these important databases far more effective.

Students, colleagues! You are very welcome to the workshop: <a href=http://www.isi.edu/projects/sciknowmine/sciknowmine_release_workshop_-_bridging_bionlp_and_biocuration>http://www.isi.edu/projects/sciknowmine/sciknowmine_release_workshop_-_bridging_bionlp_and_biocuration</a>
