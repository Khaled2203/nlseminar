Text-to-text applications -- Machine Translation, Summarization, Question
Answering -- do not usually involve generic Natural Language Generation
(NLG) systems in their generation components, but rather use
application-specific algorithms. The main reason for this state of affairs
is that virtually all the formalisms used by current generic NLG systems
require information that cannot be reliably extracted from unrestricted
text.

This thesis proposal is about meeting the demand for natural language
generation in the context of text-to-text applications. I introduce a new
representation formalism (WIDL-expressions), propose generation algorithms
that operate on representations specific to this formalism, and discuss a
generic sentence realization framework for text-to-text applications. The
generation mechanism is based on algorithms for intersecting
WIDL-expressions with probabilistic language models. I present both
theoretical and empirical results concerning the correctness and
efficiency of these algorithms. I also discuss the practical aspects
arising from implementing this generation mechanism.

In a concrete application of the proposed generation mechanisms, I present
an end-to-end Machine Translation application. I also discuss another
possible application for Automated Summarization, namely automated
headline generation.
