Better k-best Parsing, Hypergraphs and Dynamic Programming

We discuss the relevance of k-best parsing to recent applications in
natural language parsing, and develop algorithms that substantially
improve on previously-used algorithms with respect to efficiency,
scalability, and accuracy. We demonstrate these algorithms in experiments
on Bikel's implementation of Collins' lexicalized PCFG model, and on a
synchronous CFG based decoder for statistical machine translation. We show
in particular how the improved output of our algorithms has the potential
to improve results from parse reranking systems and other applications.

In this talk, I will demonstrate the convergence of several popular
parsing formalisms (weighted deduction, shared forest, semiring) under the
powerful hypergraph formalism. If time permits, I will also show how
generic Dynamic Programming can be formalised as hypergraph searching.
