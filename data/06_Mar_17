Tiburon: A Finite State Tree Automata Toolkit

In the 1990s, researchers applied their new developments in transducer
theory using widely available easy-to-use toolkits for string transducers,
and made well-known advances in parsing, machine translation, and other
areas. Rapid prototyping via software such as the AT&T toolkit and carmel
was useful for proofs of concept and in many cases led to unforseen
developments in novel areas. In the current nlp research environment tree
based strategies and new models have shown promising results in advancing
the state of the art, and recent developments in weighted tree automata
theory are enriching the bedrock created 40 years ago, but as of yet there
is no toolkit available with the necessary capabilities to turn promise
into solution.

Tiburon is the first probablistic tree transducer toolkit. Similar in form
and function to the string-based toolkits of yesteryear, it is designed to
be easy to use, with simple but expressive definitions of tree automata
and a concise set of vital operations that can be used to construct many
useful tree-based nlp projects. Although a work in progress, Tiburon is
already a usable tool with active users between the ages of 6 and 41. I
will describe the current status of the system, demonstrate ease of use
and potential power, and discuss the challenges ahead.
