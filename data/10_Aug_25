Intern Final Talk: Making Discriminative Alignment Smarter
2:00 pm - 2:30 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

Error analysis on grammars extracted for Machine Translation shows
that bad and useless translation rules are usually caused by bad
alignments. In this work, we improve previous work on hierarchical
discriminative alignment by incorporating knowledge of foreign side
parse trees, output from other aligners, and a look-ahead to grammar
extraction. We give examples and results on Chinese to English
translation.
