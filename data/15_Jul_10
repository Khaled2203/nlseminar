Parsing with word vectors

We investigate the use of distributed word representations instead of word forms and parts of speech in syntactic parsing.  Distributed representations are dense, low-dimensional, and real valued vector representations (embeddings) for words.  Instead of ad-hoc feature conjunctions, we use kernels and neural networks for non-linearity, greatly simplifying feature engineering.  We show that dense representations offer both computational and learning advantages compared to sparse one-hot vector representations.  We introduce context vectors, distributed representations for word contexts, and show that they can replace or complement parts of speech in parsing models.  We show that distributed representations give accuracies comparable to the state-of-the-art word form and part-of-speech based feature sets.

Bio. Deniz Yuret is an associate professor of Computer Engineering at Koç University in Istanbul working at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory since 2002. Previously he was at the MIT AI Lab (1988-1999) and later co-founded Inquira, Inc., a company commercializing question answering technology (2000-2002). He has worked on supervised and unsupervised approaches to syntax, morphology, lexical semantics and lexical categories.  His most recent work is on creation and applications of continuous word embeddings.
