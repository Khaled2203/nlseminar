People make explicit subjective judgments of speech when doing things like tutoring students in a foreign language, or testing a child's reading skills.  On what do we base these judgments, and how can they be made automatically?  The "quality" of speech does not exist on any one scale alone, and is not limited strictly to pronunciation - it is manifested through a multiplicity of simultaneous and interacting cues of various sizes.  In this talk I'll discuss modeling strategies for categorical pronunciation on several scales, cognitive models for estimating student knowledge demonstrated through speech, and applications in the fields of education and speech synthesis.
