Automatic word alignment is the problem of automatically annotating
parallel text with translational correspondence. Previous generative
word alignment models have made structural assumptions such as the
1-to-1, 1-to-N, or phrase-based consecutive word assumptions, while
previous discriminative models have either made one of these
assumptions directly or used features derived from a generative model
using one of these assumptions. We present a new generative alignment
model which avoids these structural limitations, and show that it is
effective when trained using both unsupervised and semi-supervised
training methods. Experiments show strong improvements in word
alignment accuracy and usage of the generated alignments in
hierarchical and phrasal SMT systems improves the BLEU score.
