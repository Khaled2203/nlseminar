Abstract:
People from different cultures and backgrounds tend to make different decisions faced with the same set of choices. Cultural background influences people's decisions in social interactions. Computational agents that are intended to simulate human behavior or engage in interpersonal interactions such as negotiation with humans need decision making models that are sensitive to culture. In this talk, we show how agents can learn to behave like people from specific cultures in the context of a negotiation game.
