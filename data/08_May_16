Topic models, a class of Bayesian probabilistic models for discrete
data, have recently gained popularity in applications ranging from
document modeling to computer vision.  Since the introduction of
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in 2003, there have been numerous
extensions to this archetype.  I will review the theory behind LDA,
and discuss subsequent models, including (some of): Correlated Topic
Model, Dynamic Topic Model, Hierarchical Topic Model, Special Words
Topic Model, Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Model, Pachinko Allocation
Machine, Topics and Syntax Model, Bi-LDA, Author-Topic Model,
Supervised Topic Model, Spatial LDA, etc.
