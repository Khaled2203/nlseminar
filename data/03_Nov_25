Hang Li (MSR Beijing)
Using Bilingual Data to Mine and Rank Translations
10:30 pm - 12:00 pm
11th Floor Large

In this talk, I will introduce some of the technologies which
we have developed in the project on an English reading assistant system
called English Reading Wizard. The technologies include a method for
mining translations from web (unparallel corpora), a method for word
translation disambiguation based on bootstrapping, which is called
Bilingual Bootstrapping, and a general method of bootstrapping, which is
called Collaborative Bootstrapping. First, I will introduce the main
features of English Reading Wizard. Next, I will introduce each of the
methods. The translation mining method is based on a naïve Bayesian
ensemble and the EM algorithm. Bilingual Bootstrapping uses the
asymmetric translation relationship between words in the two languages
in translation and can construct reliable classifiers for word
translation disambiguation. Collaborative Bootstrapping contains the
co-training algorithm as its special case, and it uses the strategy of
uncertainty reduction in training of the two classifiers.
