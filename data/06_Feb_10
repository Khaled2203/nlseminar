The Arabic language exhibits diglossia, i.e., the coexistence of two forms
of language, a variety with standard orthography and sociopolitical clout
which is not natively spoken by anyone (Modern Standard Arabic, MSA) and
varieties that are primarily spoken and lack writing standards (Arabic
dialects). There are important resources currently available for MSA with
much on-going NLP work; for example, there is an Arabic Treebank and
several syntactic parsers for MSA.  However, Arabic dialect resources and
NLP research are still at an infancy stage. I will present work done at
the Johns Hopkins CLSP Summer Workshop on parsing of Arabic dialects, in
particular, Levantine Arabic.  We have experimented with three approaches
to leveraging MSA resources to create a parser for Levantine Arabic, as
well as methods for induction of MSA-Levantine translation lexicons and a
Levantine part-of-speech tagger. Using these methods we obtain error
reductions of up to 15% compared with applying an MSA parser directly to
Levantine text.
