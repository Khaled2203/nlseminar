Towards automatic extraction of experimental data from scientific papers [Intern final talk] 
3:30 pm - 4:30 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

Many areas of science have experienced rapid growth in the amount of scientific literature published. For example, there are approximately 400 new papers published each year in the area of Machine Translation. As such amount of new data is virtually impossible to processes by a single researcher, a new tool is needed that would help researchers explore existing and discover new MT literature. To address this problem we built an approach for automatic extraction of experimental data from scientific papers that populates a database enabling structured queries.
