Term weighting methods have been shown to give significant increases
in information retrieval performance. Term weights are typically
calculated using frequency counts across the whole retrieval
collection, frequency of each term within individual documents and
compensation for varying document length. The presence of pronomial
references in documents effectively reduces the within document term
frequency of associated words with a consequent effect on term weights
and information retrieval behaviour. This presentation will describe
an experimental investigation into the impact on information retrieval
performance of broad coverage automatic pronoun resolution. Results
using a standard information retieval test collection indicate that
calculating term weights using a pronoun resolved version of the
document test collection can improve both fixed cutoff and average
retrieval precision.
