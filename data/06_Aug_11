Textual Entailment: Framework, Learning and Applications

Textual Entailment has been proposed recently as a generic framework
for modeling semantic variability in many Natural Language Processing
applications, such as Question Answering, Information Extraction,
Information Retrieval and Document Summarization. The Textual
Entailment relationship holds between two text fragments, termed text
and hypothesis, if the truth of the hypothesis can be inferred from
the text.

In this talk, the Textual Entailment framework will be introduced.
I'll then present an algorithm for large-scale Web-based acquisition
of entailment rules, a type of knowledge needed for robust inference.
Finally, I will present an unsupervised Relation Extraction approach
based on the Textual Entailment framework.

About the speaker:

Idan Szpektor is a PhD student under the supervision of Dr. Ido Dagan
at Bar Ilan University, Israel. His current research activity is in
acquisition of knowledge for textual entailment.
