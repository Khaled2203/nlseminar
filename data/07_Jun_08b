We describe existing forward and backward bisimulation minimisation
algorithms for nondeterministic automata and extend these algorithms
to weighted tree automata. The extended algorithms, which work for all
semirings, retain the time complexity of their counterparts for
unweighted tree automata for additively cancellative semirings, and
are only slightly higher (linear instead of logarithmic in the number
of states) on other semirings. We describe the effectiveness of an
implementation of these algorithms on a typical task in natural
language processing. 

This is joint work with Johanna Hogberg, Umea University and Andreas
Maletti, Technische Universitat Dresden.
