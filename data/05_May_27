We describe a new sentence realization framework for text-to-text
applications. This framework uses IDL-expressions as a representation
formalism, and a generation mechanism based on algorithms for intersecting
IDL-expressions with probabilistic language models. We present both
theoretical and empirical results concerning the correctness and
efficiency of these algorithms.
