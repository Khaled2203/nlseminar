Large Scale Syntactic Language Modeling with Treelets

We propose a simple generative syntactic language model that conditions on overlapping tree contexts in the same way that n-gram language models condition on overlapping sentence context. We estimate the parameters of our model by collecting counts from automatically parsed text using standard n-gram language model estimation techniques, allowing us to train a model on over one billion tokens of data using a single machine in a mater of hours. We evaluate on a range of grammaticality tasks, and find that we consistently outperform n-gram models and other generative baselines, and even compete with state-of-the-art discriminative models hand-designed for each task, despite training on positive data alone. We also show some improvements in preliminary machine translation experiments.
