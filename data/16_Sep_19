Duolingo: Improving Language Learning and Assessment with Data
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

Duolingo is a language education platform with more than 150 million students worldwide. Our flagship learning app is the #1 way to learn a language online, and is the most-downloaded education app for both Android and iOS devices. It is also completely free. In this talk, I will describe the Duolingo system and several empirical projects, which mix machine learning with computational linguistics and psychometrics to improve learning, engagement, and even language proficiency assessment through our products.

Burr Settles is a scientist, engineer, and head of research at Duolingo: the most widely used education application in the world, teaching 20 languages to more than 150 million users worldwide. He is also the principal developer of the Duolingo English Test: a computer-adaptive proficiency exam that aims to disrupt and democratize the global certification marketplace through highly accessible mobile technology. Before joining Duolingo, he earned a PhD in computer sciences at University of Wisconsin-Madison, and then worked as a postdoctoral research scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, where his work has spanned machine learning, natural language processing, and computational social science. His 2012 book Active Learning is now the standard text on learning algorithms that are adaptive, curious, or exploratory (if you will). Burr gets around by bike and (among other things) plays guitar in the pop band delicious pastries.
