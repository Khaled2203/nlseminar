Abstract: How to use NLP techniques to help medical researchers is crucial now. And making use of millions of medical passages is a good starting point. By doing this, we can extract useful information from these papers and help medical researchers a lot.

I’ll introduce a simple method to extract relations between proteins using AMR. By using this rule-base system, we can get AMR representation to simplified AMR(SMR) which only contains protein relation information.
