The fundamental task in statistical machine translation (SMT) is to  
characterize the probability of a target sentence given its source  
translation; for translating French as English, P(f | e). By applying  
Bayes Rule, we derive the fundamental theorem of SMT: e maximizing  
P(e) P(f | e). Advances in SMT come from improving estimations of  
these two terms, or from more efficient ways of searching for optimal  
solutions (Brown et al. 1993).

In the case of language modeling, Shannon (1949) and Brown et al.  
(1992) identified upper and lower bounds for the per-character entropy  
of English, H(e), for humans and machines, respectively. We ask the  
same question for SMT, H(e | f), comparing the results for human  
translators and a simple machine baseline based on IBM Model 1. These  
numbers are the upper and lower bounds for SMT systems trained on  
parallel data.
