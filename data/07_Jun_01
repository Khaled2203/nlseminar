In this paper, we analyze the effect of resampling techniques,
including under-sampling and over-sampling used in active learning for
word sense disambiguation (WSD). Experimental results show that
under-sampling causes negative effects on active learning, but
over-sampling is a relatively good choice. To alleviate the
within-class imbalance problem of over-sampling, we propose a
bootstrap-based over-sampling (BootOS) method that works better than
ordinary over-sampling in active learning for WSD. Finally, we
investigate when to stop active learning, and adopt two strategies,
max-confidence and min-error, as stopping conditions for active
learning. According to experimental results, we sug-gest a prediction
solution by considering max-confidence as the upper bound and
min-error as the lower bound for stopping conditions.
