Cross lingual transfer and learning with side information
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

I will describe a framework for cross-lingual transfer of
probabilistic models that uses posterior regularization.  As a long
aside, I will describe several methods for learning with side
information: constraint driven learning, posterior regularization,
generalized expectation, augmented loss as well as how they relate to
each other and to Bayesian measurements.   I will conclude with some
applications from my work and from the literature, including sequence
and tree models.

Biography:

I was born in Sofia, Bulgaria where I lived until February 1989. My
family moved to Zimbabwe and then in 1995 to New Zealand where I went
to high school. I came to the US in 1999 to study at Swarthmore
College. I spent the 2001-2002 academic year studying abroad in Paris.
After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science in 2003 I
worked at StreamSage Inc. in Washington DC until starting at the
University of Pennsylvania in Fall 2004. During the summer of 2007 I
was an intern at TrialPay in Mountain View, CA and during the summer
of 2008 I was an intern at Bank of America in New York. I graduated
from UPenn in 2010 and have since been working at Google Inc. in New
York.
