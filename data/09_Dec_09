Tomohide Shibata (Kyoto University)
Introduction of Our Research (text analysis and IR)
3:30 pm - 4:30 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

I am Tomohide Shibata, an assistant professor at Kyoto University,
Japan. I am working with Prof. Kurohashi. I have been visiting
Prof. Hovy for three weeks. In this talk, I introduce our
research. Our research roughly consists of three fields: basic text
analysis, information retrieval and machine translation. Among them,
basic text analysis and information retrieval, which I am engaged in,
are introduced.

In basic text analysis, we have been developed Japanese morphological
analyzer and parser, which are widely used in research community. Case
frames, which describe the relation between a verb and its case
components, are automatically constructed from a large Web
corpus. Synonym and is-a relations are automatically extracted from a
dictionary and Web corpus.

In Information Retrieval, we are running a search engine
infrastructure called TSUBAKI. The features of TSUBAKI are (i) the
sentence structure (dependency relation) is considered in the document
ranking, and (ii) the expression divergence between a query and a
document is assimilated. We are also running a search result
clustering system based on TSUBAKI.
