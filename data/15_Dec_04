What Can We Learn From An Agent that Plays Word-Guessing Games?
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
6th Floor Large Conference Room [689]

In this talk I will discuss an agent that can play a simple word-guessing game with a user.   The fast-paced, multi-modal, and interactive nature of the dialogue that takes place in word-guessing games are challenging for todayâ€™s dialogue systems to emulate.   The agent serves as a research testbed to explore issues of fast-paced incremental interaction and user satisfaction in such a setting.  I will trace how the agent's design was motivated by a human-human corpus as well as discuss two empirical studies involving the agent.  The first study was designed to learn an algorithm to automatically select effective clues (clues likely to elicit a correct guess from a human).  The second study was an evaluation of several synthetic voices and 1 human voice which showed how participant's subjective perceptions and objective task performances fluctuated based on the voice used and the duration of the participant's exposure to the voice.
