Representation Learning for Human Affect Recognition  (PhD Proposal Practice Talk)
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

Recent advances in end-to-end representation learning have made impressive strides in achieving state-of-the-art results in perception problems on speech, image and natural language. However, the area of affect understanding has mostly relied on off-the-shelf features to solve problems in emotion recognition, multi-modal fusion and generative modeling of affective speech and language. The potential impact of representation learning approaches to this area remains ripe for exploration. My thesis proposal is an important step in this direction. Firstly, I present an overview of my work on AU (Action Unit) detection, speech emotion recognition and glottal inverse filtering through speech modeling. Secondly, I introduce Affect-LM, a novel neural language model for affective text generation which exploits prior knowledge through a dictionary of emotionally colored words (such as the LIWC tool). Finally, I state some upcoming problems in representation learning for affect from speech and multi-modal language modeling which I plan to work on for the remainder of my degree.

Sayan is a fourth-year PhD student at the University of Southern California, working at the Behavior Analytics and Machine Learning Group at the ICT(Institute for Creative Technologies) with Prof. Stefan Scherer. He is working on research towards building learning systems for better sensing of human behavior and emotion, and integrating deep learning techniques with human affect. His areas of interest include, but are not limited to deep learning, machine perception, affective computing, speech/signal processing, and generative modeling.
