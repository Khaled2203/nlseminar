Structured Predictions: Practical Advancements and Applications in Natural Language Processing
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

Many machine learning problems involve making joint
predictions over a set of mutually dependent output variables. The
dependencies between output variables can be represented by a
structure, such as a sequence, a tree, a clustering of nodes, or a
graph. Structured prediction models have been proposed for problems of
this type. In this talk, I will describe a collection
of results that improve several aspects of these approaches. Our
results lead to efficient and effective algorithms for learning structured
prediction models, which, in turn, support weak supervision signals and improve training and evaluation speed.
I will also discuss potential risks and challenges when using structured prediction models
