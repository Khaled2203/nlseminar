Parsing and translating natural languages can be viewed as
structured-prediction problems. We outline the crucial design
decisions that must be made to build a machine to solve structured
prediction problems, and explain our particular choices for these two
large-scale NLP problems.  Our approach uses a purely discriminative
learning method that scales up well to problems of this size.  Unlike
currently popular methods, this one does not require a great deal of
feature engineering a priori, because it performs feature selection
over a compound feature space as it learns.  Accuracy on constituent
parsing was at least as good as other comparable methods.  To our
knowledge, it is the first purely discriminative learning algorithm
for translation with tree-structured models.  Experiments demonstrate
the method's versatility, accuracy, and efficiency.
