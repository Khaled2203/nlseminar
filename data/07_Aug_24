Noisy Language Models

The language models used in statistical machine translation are often
quite large, requiring significant memory and sometimes pre-processing
in order to be utilized effectively. It would be desirable to have a
more compact representations of language models while minimizing the
impact on translation quality. Various quantization methods and lossy
storage of language models will be presented.

Context for Syntax-Based Translation Rules

The rules that a translation system employs should be applicable in
many contexts.  This ensures that a rich language is expressible with
a minimum number of rules.  However, when rules that are applicable in
too many contexts are combined, they result in nonsensical
translations.  How can we keep rules general but constrain the context
of their use?  This summer we explored the approach of constraining
the context by conditioning on various neighboring elements of each
rule.
