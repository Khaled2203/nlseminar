Algorithmic Bias in Artificial Intelligence: The Seen and Unseen Factors Influencing Machine Perception of Images and Language
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

The success of machine learning has surged, with similar algorithmic approaches effectively solving a variety of human-defined tasks.  Tasks testing how well machines can perceive images and communicate about them have exposed strong effects of different types of bias, such as selection bias and dataset bias.  In this talk, I will unpack some of these biases, and how they affect machine perception today.

Bio: Margaret Mitchell is a Senior Research Scientist in Google's Research & Machine Intelligence group, working on artificial intelligence. Her research generally involves vision-language and grounded language generation, focusing on how to evolve artificial intelligence towards positive goals. This includes research on helping computers to communicate based on what they can process, as well as projects to create assistive and clinical technology from the state of the art in AI.
