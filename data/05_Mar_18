This talk is the second in three tutorial lectures on ontologies.  It
first shows some details of various Upper Ontologies-ResearchCYC, SUMO,
DOLCE, and the Penman Upper Model.  It then discusses the problem of
creating content for the 'Middle Model' zone of ontologies, and outlines a
methodology for moving from words to word senses to concepts.  It
concludes by describing ISI's Omega ontology and showing how Omega has
been used in annotation projects to support semantic labeling of texts.

Please bring a pen or pencil and some paper; there is a small exercise!
