User-generated passwords tend to be memorable,  but  not  secure.   A  random,  computer-generated 60-bit string is much more secure.
However, users cannot memorize random 60-bit strings. In this paper, we investigate methods for converting arbitrary bit strings into English word sequences (both prose and poetry), and  we  study  their  memorability  and  other properties.
