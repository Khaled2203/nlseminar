Although a considerable number of generic Natural Language Generation
(NLG) systems has been produced over the years, none of them is usually
employed in end-to-end, text-to-text applications such as Machine
Translation, Summarization, Question Answering, etc. In this talk, we
identify the likely reasons for this state of affairs, and propose
WIDL-expressions as a flexible formalism that facilitates the integration
of a generic NLG engine within end-to-end language processing
applications.
 
WIDL-expressions represent compactly probability distributions over finite
sets of candidate realizations, and have optimal algorithms for text
realization via interpolation with language model probability
distributions. We show the effectiveness of our WIDL-based NLG engine for
both sentence realization and document realization tasks. By employing
language models that capture sentence-level properties, we perform Machine
Translation and Headline Generation at state-of-the-art levels or better.
By employing language models that capture document-level properties such
as text coherence, we synthesize output for Multi-document Summarization
that displays both high content selection performance and increased
coherence.
