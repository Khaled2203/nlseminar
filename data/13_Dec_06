Learning Hierarchical Tasks from Situated Interactive Instruction
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

Our research aims at building interactive robots and agent that can expand their knowledge by interacting with human users. In this talk, I will give an overview of our ongoing work on learning novel tasks from linguistic, mixed-initiative instructions. The first part of the talk will address the problems of situated language comprehension for cognitive agents in real-world environments. The second part will focus on task learning. I will discuss the knowledge representations we employ to represent hierarchical, goal-oriented tasks and how this knowledge can be learned from interactions using an explanation-based learning framework.
