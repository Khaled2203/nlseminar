Automated Essay Evaluation: From NLP research through deployment as a business

Automated essay scoring was initially motivated by its potential cost
savings for large-scale writing assessments.  However, as automated essay
scoring became more widely available and accepted, teachers and assessment
experts realized that the potential of the technology could go way beyond
just essay scoring.  Over the past five years or so, there has been rapid
development, and commercial deployment of automated essay evaluation for
both large-scale assessment and classroom instruction.  A number of
factors contribute to an essay score, including varying sentence
structure, grammatical correctness, appropriate word choice, errors in
spelling and punctuation, use of transitional words/phrases, and
organization and development. Instructional software capabilities exist
that provide essay scores and evaluations of student essay writing in all
of these domains.  The foundation of automated essay evaluation software
is rooted in NLP research.  This talk will walk through the development of
CriterionSM, e-rater, and Critique writing analysis tools, automated essay
evaluation software developed at Educational Testing Service - from NLP
research through deployment as a business.
