Modeling Topics, Opinions and Discourse Structure in Asynchronous Conversations
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
6th Floor Large Conference Room [Rm 689]

Due to the Internet revolution, human conversational data--in written forms--are accumulating at a phenomenal rate, as more and more people engage  in email exchanges, blogging, texting and other social media activities. In this talk, we will present automatic methods for analyzing conversational text generated in asynchronous conversations, i.e., where participants communicate with each other at different times (e.g., email, blog, forum). Our focus will be on novel techniques to detect the topics covered in the conversation, to identify whether an utterance in the conversation is expressing an opinion, as well as to determine the discourse structure of each message. In our work, we apply both graph-based methods and probabilistic graphical models.
