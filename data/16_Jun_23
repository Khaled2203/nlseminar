Abstract: Transition-based methods leverage non-local features for structured tasks. When combined with beam search and global structure learning, they give high accuracies for a number of NLP tasks. We investigate the effectiveness of neural network models for transition-based parsing and Chinese word segmentation. Results show that automatic features induced by neural models give higher accuracies than carefully designed manual features. The beam search and perceptron learning framework of Zhang and Clark (2011) can be used with neural network models. However, large margin training does not always work. When the number of labels are many, a maximum likelihood training objective with contrastive estimation learning gives better accuracies.
