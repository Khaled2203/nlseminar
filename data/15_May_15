Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and its Bayesian nonparametric generalization hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDP) have been proven successful in modeling large, complex, real-world domains. However, inference on LDA/HDP is challenging and it has received notable attention from the researchers. In this talk, we present two algorithmic advances for LDA/HDP inference by examining their mathematical properties. We will first present an effective parallel Gibbs sampling algorithm for LDA/HDP by exploring the equivalency between the Dirichlet-multinomial hierarchy and the Gamma-Poisson hierarchy. Secondly, we will show how to provably select the number of topics for LDA by studying the spectral space of its second order moments (bi-gram statistics).
