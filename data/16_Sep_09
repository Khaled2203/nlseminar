How we Cracked the “Borg” Cipher + First Steps Towards Deciphering from Images
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

European libraries are filled with undeciphered historical manuscripts from the 16th-18th centuries. These documents are enciphered with classical methods, which puts their contents out of the reach of historians who are interested in the history of that era.
In this talk, we show how we automatically cracked a 400-page book from the 17th century. We also describe a system aimed at deciphering from camera-phone images. We show initial results for different ciphers.
