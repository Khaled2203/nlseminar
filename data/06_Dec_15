In this talk I will examine problems encountered in coming to some
kind of understanding of one sonnet by Shakespeare (his 64th), ask
what it would take to solve these problems computationally, and
suggests routes to the solution.  The general conclusion is that we
are closer to this goal as one might think.  Or are we?

Bio:

Jerry Hobbs is famous primarily for having an office next to Kevin
Knight's and a parking space next to Ed Hovy's.  He has read
everything of Shakespeare's that survives, including his will and
plays of dubious authorship.  But that was all a long time ago.
