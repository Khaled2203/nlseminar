Abstract: We advance the state of the art in biomolecular interaction extraction with three contributions: (i) We show that deep, Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR) significantly improve the accuracy of a biomolecular interaction extraction system when compared to a baseline that relies solely on surface- and syntax-based features; (ii) In contrast with previous approaches that infer relations on a sentence-by-sentence basis, we expand our framework to enable consistent predictions over sets of sentences (documents); (iii) We further modify and expand a graph kernel learning framework to enable concurrent exploitation of automatically induced AMR (semantic) and dependency structure (syntactic) representations. Our experiments show that our approach yields interaction extraction systems that are more robust in environments where there is a significant mismatch between training and test conditions.

Bio: Sahil Garg is a PhD student, advised by Prof. Aram Galstyan, in computer science department of Viterbi school of engineering at University of Southern California. He is interested in problem oriented research. In the past, he developed machine learning, information theoretic algorithms for real world problems such as sensing environmental dynamics using mobile robotic sensors. In this talk, he is going to discuss his recent work on extracting bio-molecular interactions from bio-medical text using semantic parsing, especially in relevance to Cancer disease.
