Unsupervised learning of verb argument structures
3:00 pm - 4:30 pm
8th floor multipurpose room (#849) -- NOT the conference room

In this talk, I'll present the investigation I'm carrying out in ISI
lately under Daniel Marcu's supervision.  Following the noisy-channel
framework, we propose a statistical model for learning the argument
structures of verbs automatically.  We show that we are able to learn both
lexicalized and generalized structures and achieve good results, relying
only on basic NLP tools like a POS tagger and named-entity recognizer. We
also present a comparison of the structures we learn with the predicted
ones in PropBank.
