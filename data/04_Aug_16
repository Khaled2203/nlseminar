Broad-coverage repositories of semantic relations between verbs could
benefit many NLP tasks. We present a semi-automatic method for extracting
fine-grained semantic relations between verbs. We detect similarity,
strength, antonymy, enablement, and temporal happens-before relations
between pairs of strongly associated verbs using lexico-syntactic patterns
over the Web. On a set of 29,165 strongly associated verb pairs, our
extraction algorithm yielded 65.5% accuracy. We provide the resource,
called VerbOcean, for download at http://semantics.isi.edu/ocean/. We will
also discuss current work on disambiguating the verbs in the network as
well as refining the semantic relations using path analysis.
