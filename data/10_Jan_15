ForeCite: towards a more integrated scholarly digital library

Scholarly digital libraries (DLs) have managed to scale up
to handle millions of documents and now feature tools to track
citations and references between articles.  However, users of digital
libraries typically often access the DL merely to check references or to
download the PDF of the document.  What features will the
next-generation DL need to inspire scholars to use digital library for
more than accessing the document?  In ForeCite, our digital library
project at NUS, we believe part of the answer lies in integrating
common end user's concerns: annotation, sharing, off-and-online usage
and focusing on the intra-document processing.  I will describe and
demonstrate some of the preliminary components of the ForeCite system:
including its web based front end, ParsCit (a backend open-source
citation segmentation system), and ForeCiteNote (TiddyWiki based
research notetaking system) and ForeCiteReader (Google Books-like
interface for annotation and collaboration on notetaking, and FireCite
(browser extension for recognizing citations on webpages).
