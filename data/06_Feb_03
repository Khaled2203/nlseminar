Measuring Word Alignment Quality for Statistical Machine Translation

Automatic word alignment plays a critical role in statistical machine
translation. Unfortunately the relationship between alignment quality and
statistical machine translation performance has not been well understood.
In the recent literature the alignment task has frequently been decoupled
from the translation task, and assumptions have been made about measuring
alignment quality for machine translation which, it turns out, are not
justified. In particular, none of the tens of papers published over the
last five years has shown that significant decreases in Alignment Error
Rate (AER) result in significant increases in translation quality. I will
explain this state of affairs and present steps towards measuring
alignment quality in a way which is predictive of statistical machine
translation quality.

I will also provide a brief overview of some of my other work on training
and search for word alignment.
