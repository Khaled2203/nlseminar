Dual Decomposition for Natural Language Inference
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

This talk presents dual decomposition as a general technique for NLP.

The first part introduces dual decomposition as a framework for
deriving inference algorithms for NLP problems. The approach relies on
standard dynamic-programming algorithms as oracle solvers for
sub-problems, together with a simple method for forcing agreement
between the different oracles. The approach provably solves a linear
programming (LP) relaxation of the global inference problem. It leads
to algorithms that are simple, in that they use existing decoding
algorithms; efficient, in that they avoid exact algorithms for the
full model; and often exact, in that empirically they often recover
the correct solution in spite of using an LP relaxation.

The second part presents an application of dual decomposition to
non-projective parsing . We focus on parsing algorithms for
non-projective head automata, a generalization of head-automata models
to non-projective structures. The dual decomposition algorithms are
simple and efficient, relying on standard dynamic programming and
minimum spanning tree algorithms. They provably solve an LP relaxation
of the non-projective parsing problem. Empirically the LP relaxation
is very often tight: for many languages, exact solutions are achieved
on over 98% of test sentences.The accuracy of our models is higher
than previous work on a broad range of datasets.
