Hal Daume III
A Phrase-Based HMM Approach to Document/Abstract Alignment

I will present work that extends the standard hidden Markov model to a
version that can emit multiple symbols in a single time step.  Using this
model, we are able to automatically create phrase-to-phrase mappings in an
alignment process.  I've applied this model to the task of creating
alignments between documents and their human-written abstracts, yielding
an overall alignment F-score of 0.548, a significant improvement on the
best results to date of 0.363.  These results are published in an EMNLP
paper this year, but the talk will be an extended version of the talk I
will give there (namely, I will discuss the mechanics of the extended HMM
in more detail in this seminar).
