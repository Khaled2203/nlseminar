Word-Level Confidence Measures for SMT

This talk will address the problem of assessing the correctness of MT
output on the word level. I will give an overview on word confidence
measures for SMT.  Different variants of word posterior probabilities that
can be directly used as confidence measure will be presented. Their
connection with the Bayes decision rule and the underlying error measure
will be shown. Experimental comparison of different word confidence
measures will be presented on a translation task consisting of technical
manuals.

Additionally, I will show how word confidence measures can be applied in
an interactive SMT system. This system predicts translations, taking parts
of the sentence into account that have already been accepted or typed by
the user. Through the use of confidence measures, the performance of the
prediction engine can be improved.
