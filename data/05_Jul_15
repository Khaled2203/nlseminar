(Yarowsky et al., 2001) present an algorithm for bootstrapping a POS
tagger for an arbitrary target language, using an existing POS tagger for
a source language and a parallel corpus in the source and target
languages.  The source text is annotated with the POS tagger; the parallel
corpus is word-aligned; the POS tags are "projected" from source to target
language; and finally smoothing is performed before training a POS tagger
for the target language on the projected annotations.

I will talk about my work (jointly with my advisor, Steve Abney, at U. of
Michigan) in which we extend this algorithm by projecting from multiple
source languages onto a target language, then combining the outputs to
compute a consensus POS tagger.  Our hypothesis is that systematic
transfer errors from different source-target pairs can be reduced by using
multiple source languages.  I will present experimental results for three
different source languages (English, German, and Spanish), and two
different target languages (French and Czech).  Our results indicate that
using multiple source languages improves performance.
