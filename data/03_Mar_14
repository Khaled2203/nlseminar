One of the key challenges in retrieval is what to do when a query term
needs to be replaced with more than one term. This problem arises in
applications such as cross language information retrieval and
thesaurus expansion. One solution is to use structured query methods,
which treat all the possible replacements as if they were one query
term by computing a joint document frequency and a joint term
frequency. This presentation will review prior work on structured
query techniques and then introduce three new variants that aim to
improve computational efficiency and to leverage estimates of
replacement probabilities to improve retrieval effectiveness. The
methods have now been tested in cross-language retrieval and
OCR-degraded text retrieval applications in which replacement
probability estimates could be estimated. In both applications, the
new structured query methods showed statistically significant
improvements in retrieval effectiveness over previously known
structured query methods.
