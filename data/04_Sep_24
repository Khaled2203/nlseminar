Domain Adaptation in Maximum Extropy Models

I will present some preliminary results on the problem of domain 
adaptation in maximum entropy models, specifically in the case when there 
is a large amount of "out of domain" data, and only a very small amount of 
"in domain" data.  The model and algorithms I present are based on the 
technique of conditional Expectation Maximization (CEM) and allow for 
relatively fast optimization of these models.  Preliminary results on some 
tasks are quite promising.
