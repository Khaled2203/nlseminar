Computing Viterbi Alignments via Integer Linear Programming
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

This talk is about an optimization problem that was shown to be
NP-hard: computing optimal alignments for the IBM-3 translation
model. I will show that in practice it can be solved quite efficiently
via Integer Linear Programming. In addition to using a standard solver
I will also show problem-specific preprocessing techniques: by
deriving upper and lower bounds, a large number of variables can be
removed from the start.

Short Bio: Thomas Schoenemann was born and grew up in Germany. He studied
Computer Science at RWTH Aachen, Germany, where he got a diploma in
2005, having written his diploma thesis on the topic of confidence
measures in machine translation in the group of Hermann
Ney. Afterwards he went to the University of Bonn, Germany, to do his
Ph.D. thesis in computer vision in the years 2006-2008. Up to a month
ago he was a postdoc in the vision group at Lund University, Sweden,
where he also resumed his work on translation. Currently he is taking
a time off to explore other fields and broaden his scope.
