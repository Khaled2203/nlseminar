Abstract: We present ongoing research into OCR for both machine print and handwriting recognition. We utilize a neural network along with LSTM's to perform OCR directly from pixel intensity. We are exploring a few novel improvements, including using a CNN for feature extraction prior to the LSTM, and combining reinforcement learning into our training to directly optimize word error rate in our test-time decoding procedure, which utilizes a (non-differentiable) language-model based decoding of the LSTM output. Finally, we present the design of the OCR system we used to win a pilot project with the US Census for recognizing handwritten first and last names.
