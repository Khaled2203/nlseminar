This tutorial is intended to provide attendees with working knowledge of the Arabic writing system. No previous experience with Arabic is required. At the end of this tutorial you should be able to read and segment individual Arabic characters, read common ligatures, identify possible affixes on stems, and understand the various lexical normalizations used in Arabic text preprocessing. The focus will be on the formal writing system in printed text for Modern Standard Arabic, although handwriting will be briefly discussed.
