We have recently proposed Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) as a
generic task that captures major semantic inferences across different
natural language processing applications. The talk will first review
the motivation and definition of the textual entailment task and the
PASCAL RTE-1,2&3 Challenges benchmarks. Then we will demonstrate
directions for building textual entailment systems, based on knowledge
acquisition and inference, and for utilizing them within concrete
applications. Furthermore, we suggest that textual entailment modeling
may become a comprehensive framework for applied semantics
research. Such framework introduces useful variants of known semantic
problems and highlights important tasks which were hardly investigated
so far at an applied computational level. The semantic modeling
perspective will be illustrated in more detail by a case study for an
entailment-based variant of word sense disambiguation. 

About the speaker:

Ido Dagan is a Senior Lecturer at the Department of Computer Science
at Bar Ilan University, Israel. His areas of interest are largely
within empirical NLP, particularly empirical approaches for applied
semantic processing. In the last few years Ido and his colleagues
introduced <i>textual entailment</i> as a generic framework for applied
semantic inference and have organized the first three rounds of the
PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenges. Ido received his
Ph.D. from the Technion. He has been a research fellow at the IBM
Haifa Scientific Center and a Member of Technical Staff at AT&T Bell
Laboratories. During 1998-2003 he was co-founder and CTO of
FocusEngine and VP of Technology of LingoMotors.
