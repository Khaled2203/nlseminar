Since part 1 of the Perl tutorial didn't cover the juicy bits (like a  
unique function in Perl), based on feedback from participants, I am  
offering a part 2 "Perl - Advanced Magick" covering:

o the slides from roughly page 40
    - The Schwartzian Transform
    - Dissecting a program
o What to do, if you do need popen or backticks?
o OO Perl - a start
o C embedding - definitely only a "start here"
o Useful recipes, e.g. interpolating variables in configuration  
scripts from Perl values.
