Tree-based probability models of translation have been proposed to take
advantage of parse trees on one, both, or neither sides of a parallel
corpus.  I will present comparative results for these three approaches for
the task of word alignment on Chinese-English and French-English data, as
well as some analysis of what is going on behind the numbers.
