Intern Final Talk: Minimum Risk Decoding over Forests

Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding improves the output of
machine translation systems by selecting a translation that matches a
large proportion of the k-best hypotheses of a system.  We extend this
idea to apply to packed forests by selecting an output sentence that
matches a large proportion of all hypotheses in the pruned forest of
derivations from a syntax-based translation system.
