Name Entity Transliteration Discovery from Large Bilingual Comparable Corpora
3:00 pm - 3:30 pm
11 Large

In this summer project, we investigate a scalable method to extract
Chinese-English name transliterations from large comparable corpora,  
which consist of two languages discussing same or similar topics. We show  
that bigram Jaccard coefficient is a good similarity method to compare English  
and Chinese names, at Chinese pronunciation (Pinyin) level. Based on this phonetic
similarity score, an efficient randomized algorithm is then used to  
find name pair candidates from English and Chinese lists. Finally, context  
information, such as dates, frequency, place and titles are combined with the  
phonetic similarity to improve the accuracy of the name pairs list.
