(Practice tutorial for ACL/COLING 2006)

Once upon a time, synchronous grammars and tree transducers were esoteric
topics in formal language theory, far removed from the practice of
building real, large-scale natural language systems. However, these tools
are now rapidly becoming essential for modeling machine translation and
other complex language transformations. It has therefore become practical
and important to understand the basic properties of tree transformation
systems, which we cover in this tutorial.
