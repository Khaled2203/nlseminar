Search, Learning and Features (my thesis proposal proposal)

I'm going to talk about what I've been working on recently.  My thesis
proposal is something having to do with the interaction of search,
learning and features in supervised natural language problems.  I will be
focusing on the task of coreference, since it is a well-studied problem,
yet nevertheless not really solved and quite difficult.  It is also a 
great pedagogical example for why we should care about something *other* 
than standard Markov random fields for structured prediction, since, for 
the coreference problem (and pretty much every other "real" natural 
language problem) inference in such models is intractable.

The contents of this talk will be roughly 40% from a paper I have at ICML
this year on efficient, accurate supervised learning techniques for
structured prediction (and why I feel inclined to make the very
controversial statement that supervised learning for NLP problems is
solved); it will be roughly 40% about an application of this technique to
the coreference resolution problem and an exploration of the feature space
for solving this problem (submitted to HLT); and it will be roughly 20%
about looking forward to what I want to accomplish in the remainder of my
thesis, not covered by the first 80%.
