(This is a practice run for I talk I will give a few times over the next
weeks when interviewing for job positions.)

I will review the state of the art in statistical machine translation
(SMT), present my dissertation work, and sketch out the research
challenges of syntactically structured statistical machine translation.

The currently best methods in SMT build on the translation of phrases (any
sequences of words) instead of single words. Phrase translation pairs are
automatically learned from parallel corpora. While SMT systems generate
translation output that often conveys a lot of the meaning of the original
text, it is frequently ungrammatical and incoherent.

The research challenge at this point is to introduce syntactic knowledge
to the state of the art in order to improve translation quality. My
approach breaks up the translation process along linguistic lines. I will
present my thesis work on noun phrase translation and ideas about clause
structure.
