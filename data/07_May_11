We compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of a syntax-based
machine translation model with a phrase-based machine translation
model on several levels.  We briefly describe each model, highlighting
points where they differ.  We include a quantitative comparison of the
phrase pairs that each model has to work with, as well as the reasons
why some phrase pairs are not learned by the syntax-based model.  We
then propose improvements to the syntax-based extraction techniques to
capture more phrases.  We also compare the translation accuracy for
all variations.
