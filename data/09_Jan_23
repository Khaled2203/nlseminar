Considering the adversity of the conditions under which linguistic communication takes place in everyday life---ambiguity of the signal, environmental competition for our attention, speaker error, our limited memory, and so forth---it is perhaps remarkable that we are as successful at it as we are.  Perhaps the leading explanation of this success is that (a) the linguistic signal is redundant, (b) diverse information sources are generally available that can help us obtain infer the intended message (or something close enough) when comprehending an utterance, and (c) we use these diverse information sources very quickly and to the fullest extent possible.  This explanation can be thought of as treating language comprehension as a rational, evidential process.  Nevertheless, there are number of prominent phenomena reported in the sentence processing literature that remain clear puzzles for the rational approach.  In this talk I address three such phenomena, whose common underlying thread is an apparent failure to use information available in a sentence appropriately in global or incremental inferences about the correct interpretation of a sentence.  I argue that the apparent puzzle posed by these phenomena for models of rational sentence comprehension may derive from the failure of existing models to appropriately account for the environmental and cognitive constraints---namely, noisy input and limited memory---under which comprehension takes place.  I present two new probabilistic models of language comprehension under noisy input and limited memory, and show that these models lead to solutions to the above puzzles.  More generally, these models suggest how appropriately accounting for environmental and cognitive constraints can lead to a more nuanced and ultimately more satisfactory picture of key aspects of human cognition.
