Recent research on statistical machine translation has lead to the rapid development of syntax-based translation models, which
exploit syntactic information to direct translation. In this talk, I
will give an overview of tree-to-string translation models, one of the
state-of-the-art syntax-based models. In a tree-to-string model, the source side is a phrase structure parse tree and the target side is a
string. This talk includes the following topics: (1) tree-based tree-to-string model, (2) tree-sequence based tree-to-string model,
(3) forest-based tree-to-string model, and (4) context-aware
tree-to-string model. Experimental results show that the forest-based
tree-to-string system outperforms Hiero significantly on Chinese-to-English translation.
