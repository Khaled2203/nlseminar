We present a method for improving word alignment for statistical syntax-based machine translation that employs a syntactically informed alignment model closer to the translation model than commonly-used word alignment models. This leads to extraction of more useful linguistic patterns and improved BLEU scores on translation experiments in Chinese and Arabic.
