Delayed LM Intersection and Left-to-Right N-Best Extraction for Syntax-Based MT

We begin by describing a set of pruning constraints that are applied
in the literature to effectively restrict the search space of
synchronous PCFGs intersected with target language model contexts. We
apply these constraints to non-binarized grammars with a large number
of non-terminals and demonstrate effective parsing within the
framework of Wu, 97.  

We then present a novel parsing approach that avoids language model
context intersection during parsing in favor of language model driven
n-best list extraction. The parsing step produces a sentence
spanning parse forest which is explored in left-to-right target order
by the N-Best extraction method. 

This method avoids lossy pruning during the parsing process, searching
a much larger effective parse space than practically possible in the
full intersection scenario, and has the important benefit of allowing
integration of a high order language within the N-Best search process,
rather than only in parse re-scoring.  

We demonstrate the impact of this parsing approach using the SPCFG
approach described in Zollmann, Venugopal, Vogel 06, which is similar
to Galley et al., 04 and compare performance against full
intersection.  

This is joint work with Andreas Zollmann
