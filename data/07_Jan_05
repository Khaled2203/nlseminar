Lexical cohesion refers to structure created in a text by use of words with
related meanings. Apart from its importance in theoretical and applied
linguistics, lexical cohesion detection is used in NLP tasks like topic
segmentation, extractive summarization, spelling correction, etc.  However, the
intuitive potential of lexical cohesion for such tasks is often not realized in
practice, possibly due to shortcomings of detection algorithms.

I will briefly describe an experiment with readers aimed at providing reliable
data for a computational investigation of lexical cohesion. We then discuss a
number of informative features for cohesion detection, drawing on sources like
WordNet, distributional information, free associations, and the structure of
information in  the text itself.  Finally, I report experiments 
with supervised learning of lexical cohesion.
