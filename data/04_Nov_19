As DARPA's TIDES (Translingual Information Detection, Extraction, and
Summarization) program coming to an end, I will give a summary of what we
have learned from TIDES in summarization and a brief overview of our
current effort in developing automatic evaluation methods that go beyond
surface n-gram matching. Topics to be covered:

(1) Summary of DUCs 2001 - 2004
(2) Automatic Evaluations in Summarization and MT
(3) Basic Elements - New Efforts in Summarization at ISI
