Weighted hypergraphs arise naturally in parsing, syntax-based machine
translation and other tree-based NLP models, as well as in weighted
logic programming.

We present an open-source toolkit for the representation and
manipulation of weighted hypergraphs. It provides hypergraph data
structures and algorithms, such as the shortest path and
inside-outside algorithms, composition, projection, and more. In
addition, it provides functionality to optimize hypergraph feature
weights from training data. We model finite-state machines as a
special case. We give a tutorial on hypergraphs and the hypergraph
toolkit and explain how you can use these tools in your research.

This is joint work with Jonathan Graehl.

Bio: Markus Dreyer is a Senior Research Scientist at SDL Language
Weaver. His research focuses on algorithms and machine learning
