Espresso: Making Use of Generic Patterns for Mining Relations from Small and Large Corpora

In the past decade, researchers have explored many approaches to
automatically extract large collections of knowledge from text. In this
talk, we present Espresso, a weakly-supervised, general-purpose, and
broad-coverage algorithm for harvesting binary semantic relations. The
main contributions are: i) a method for exploiting generic patterns by
filtering incorrect instances using the Web; and ii) a principled measure
of pattern and instance reliability enabling the filtering algorithm. We
present an empirical comparison of Espresso with various state of the art
systems, on different size and genre corpora, on extracting various
general and specific relations. Experimental results show that our
exploitation of generic patterns substantially increases system recall
with small effect on overall precision.
