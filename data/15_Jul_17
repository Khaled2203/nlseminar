Shift-Reduce CCG Parsing with a Dependency Model
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
6th Floor Large Conference Room [689]

CCG is able to derive typed dependency structures, providing a useful
approximation to the underlying predicate-argument relations of “who
did what to whom” and dependency structures form an integral part of
CCG. In this talk, I will first cover some essential background on
CCG, its dependency structures and CCG parsing; I will then discuss a
recent dependency model we developed for shift-reduce CCG parsing.  A
challenge arises in this model from the fact that the oracle needs to
keep track of exponentially many gold-standard derivations, which are
all hidden. And we solve this by integrating a packed parse forest
with the beam-search decoder and introduce a novel technique for
querying an exponentially-sized oracle on-the-fly during beam-search
decoding.

Bio. Wenduan Xu is a graduate student in Cambridge advised by Stephen Clark,
working on CCG parsing.
