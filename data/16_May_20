Title: Natural Language Communication with Computers
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
6th Floor Large Conference Room [689]

Abstract: We propose a framework for devising testable algorithms for bridging the communication gap between humans and robots.  We begin with a setting in which humans give instructions to robots using unrestricted language commands, with instruction sequences aimed at building complex goal configurations in a blocks world.  I will present details of our data-collection effort, and preliminary results on action understanding.  Time permitting, I will present new baseline results for flipping the semantic parsing paradigm to address the problem of language generation, where a human performs commands produced by a machine to demonstrate basic two-way communication.
