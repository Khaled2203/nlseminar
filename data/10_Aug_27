Sasha Rush
Intern Final Talk: Large-scale, High-dimensional, Discriminative Machine Translation
3:00 pm - 3:30 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

This talk summarizes my summer work on scaling a machine translation
system to train on a large data set. Similar system are tuned with
MERT on 1k sentences, we train a CRF on 100k sentences. I will discuss
techniques for training, features, distributed scaling,
regularization, and tuning, and give preliminary results.
