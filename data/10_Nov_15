Structured Models for Bilingual Alignment (Ph.D. Proposal practice talk)
4:00 pm - 5:00 pm
4th Floor Conference Room [460]

Bilingual alignment serves as an integral step and the foundation in
the building of any state-of-the-art statistical machine translation
system. It enables us to automatically learn and extract translation
rules from hundreds of millions of words of bilingual text.

Twenty years ago, the research area of machine translation was
beginning to make use of the increasing availability and speed of
computing resources demanded by the ideas of a previous generation,
notably Weaver (1949). The IBM translation models -- statistical
models for automatic word-to-word translation (Brown et al., 1990;
Brown et al., 1993) - spurred a flurry of new statistical and
empirical research in this area. They have become ubiquitous in the
field and are easy to train in an unsupervised fashion; Al-Onaizan et
al. (1999) and Och and Ney (2003) have given us open-source toolkits
for this purpose.

However, there are many problems that still exist. The work presented
in this thesis proposal will eliminate many of the problems with
alignment systems that have persisted for two decades, significantly improving machine translation
quality and decidedly advancing the state-of-the-art. In achieving
this goal, we develop new models of bilingual alignment and efficient
search algorithms for working with such models.
