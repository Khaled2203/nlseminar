Marcello Federico
Statistical Machine Translation at ITC-irst
3:00 pm - 4:30 pm
4th Floor

My presentation will overview recent activities on Chinese-English SMT
carried out at ITC-irst (Trento, Italy).  After an overview of the
complete architecture of our system, I will focus on progress made in
Chinese word-segmentation, phrase-based modeling and decoding, log-linear
modeling and minimum error training, and language model adaptation.
Experimental results will be provided in terms of Bleu and Nist scores on
two translation tasks:  basic traveling expressions and news reports,
respectively adopted by the C-STAR consortium and for the 2002 and 2003
NIST MT evaluation campaigns.
