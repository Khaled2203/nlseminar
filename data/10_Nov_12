Stephen Tratz
Semantically-enriched Parsing for Natural Language Understanding (Ph.D. Proposal practice talk)
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

Natural language is riddled with many ambiguities, greatly complicating
natural language processing tasks. Current parsers reconstruct the
syntax of sentences without addressing the numerous ambiguities of
language. This talk discusses a proposed solution for
semantically-enriched parsing that consists of ontological resources,
datasets, and tools that can be used to produce more informative parses
of English sentences. The resulting parses consist not only of syntactic
structure, but also semantic interpretations for noun compounds,
preposition senses, and possessive constructions.
