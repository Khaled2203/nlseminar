I'll describe our entry into the DUC 2004 automatic document summarization
competition.  We competed only in the single document, headline generation
task.  Our system is based on a novel kernel dubbed the tree position
kernel, combined with two other well-known kernels.  Our system performs
well on white-box evaluations, but does very poorly in the overall DUC
evaluation.  C'est la vie.
