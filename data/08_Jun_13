Effective Information Extraction with Relevant Regions and Semantic Affinity Patterns

I will briefly overview the landscape of event-oriented information
extraction (IE) systems and explain why it is especially challenging
to learn IE systems without annotated training data. Then I will
describe one attempt to do so by decoupling the tasks of finding
relevant text regions and applying extraction patterns. First, a
self-trained relevant sentence classifier identifies relevant regions
in documents. Second, a "semantic affinity" measure identifies
domain-relevant extraction patterns.  We further distinguish between
"primary" patterns and "secondary" patterns and apply the patterns
selectively in the relevant regions.  This approach is weakly
supervised, requiring only a few seed patterns plus relevant and
irrelevant (but unannotated) documents for training.  The resulting IE
system achieves reasonably good performance, despite the fact that the
relevant region classifier leaves a lot to be desired.
