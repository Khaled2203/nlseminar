I would like to talk about some of the things I did during the last 
year. I will discuss and demonstrate CuSTaRD, a cross-lingual 
information retrieval, organization, summarization, and visualization 
system that was built for the Surprise Language exercise. I will focus 
in more details on iNeATS, the interactive multi-document summarization 
part of CuSTaRD. The other project I plan to present is eArchivarius, a 
system for accessing collections of electronic mail.
