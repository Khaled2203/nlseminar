Working with Large Corpus, High speed clustering and its applications
3:00 pm - 4:30 pm
11 Large

I am going to be talking about stuff that I have been working over the
past 6-9 months. This includes randomized algorithms and its application
to 2 NLP problems: noun clustering and noun-pair clustering. I will also
be commenting on my experience of working with very very large amounts of
real Natural Language text (This includes processing and working with data
available from the web. This corpus is not the standard newspaper text
that we are so used to in the NLP community.) This talk will also cover a
large part of my thesis work.
