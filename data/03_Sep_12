In this talk, I look at how the notion of discourse coherence can be
modeled computationally. I begin with the following idea: if you take
a text and shuffle its sentences into a random order, that text will
no longer make sense. In other words, the text will be "incoherent".
Our task is to learn how to reassemble a shuffled text into an order
that humans would consider to be coherent.

I discuss practical and theoretical motivations for the task,
evaluations of our model, increases in performance achieved over the
summer, and directions for future research.

This work was done in collaboration with Kevin Knight, Daniel Marcu,
Jonathan Graehl and Nick Mote.
