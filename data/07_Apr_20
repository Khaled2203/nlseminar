We present a survey of resent research into using information visualization
to reveal new insights about linguistic data.  Our recent work includes
using WordNet hyponymy as a basis for document visualization and visualizing
the uncertainty in machine translation in an instant messaging chat
context.  We will present our preliminary findings and prototype
visualization for machine translation data resulting from a week of
collaboration with ISI researchers.
