David Chiang 
Tutorial on HPC
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

This tutorial will be a short introduction to using the Linux cluster at 
USC's High-Performance Computing (HPC) facility. Topics will include:
    (1) basics of starting jobs on the cluster using Torque/PBS,
    (2) dealing with common problems like jobs not starting or 
spontaneously dying,
    (3) maximizing the performance of your jobs (both yours and other 
people's), e.g., using the correct filesystem and tuning it for better speed, 
    (4) embarrassingly parallel processing and poor-man's workflows.

It will NOT cover 
    Hadoop,
    MPI,
    real workflow management tools like Condor.
