More than One Sense Per Discourse

    Previous research has indicated that when a polysemous word appears two
    or more times in a discourse, it is extremely likely that they will all
    share the same sense (Gale et al. 92). However, those results were
    based on a coarse-grained distinction between senses (e.g, {\em
    sentence} in the sense of a `prison sentence' vs. a `grammatical
    sentence'). I conducted an analysis of multiple senses within two
    sense-tagged corpora, Semcor and DSO. These corpora used WordNet for
    their sense inventory. I found significantly more occurrences of
    multiple-senses per discourse than reported in (Gale et al. 92) (33\%
    instead of 4\%). I also found classes of ambiguous words in which as
    many as 45\% of the senses in the class co-occur within a document. I
    will discuss the implications of these results for the task of 
    word-sense tagging and for the way in which senses should be  
    represented.
