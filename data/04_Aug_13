Randomized algorithms and its application to NLP

The last decade has seen a plethora of papers in NLP devoted to Machine
Learning algorithms. However, most of these papers have devoted their
effort exclusively to improving the system performance on the accuracy
axis. Most of the sophisticated NLP algorithms are extremely slow and do
not scale up easily when applied to large amounts of data.

I will talk about the importance of randomized algorithms and their
potential in speeding up some NLP algorithms. This talk will be a survey
of some recent advances in Theoretical Computer Science/Math seen with an
NLP point-of-view. I am not going to present any results. But I am hoping
that this talk will clarify my thinking process, get feedback from people
and help me colloborate with others.
