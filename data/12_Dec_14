Ulf Hermjakob
Launching Semantics-Based Machine Translation
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Conference Room [1135]

I will present work defining an Abstract Meaning Represention (AMR)
(joint work with Kevin Knight et al.) that serves as an intermediate
semantic structure when translating between languages such as Chinese
and English as well as automatic and manual annotation efforts to
build corpora of AMRs.

I will give a demo of our web-based AMR Editor, which is used by dozens
of annotators at LDC, SDL/LanguageWeaver (Cluj) and other places.
Finally, I will give an overview of our initial end-to-end prototype,
with rule extraction (own work), decoding from source language to AMR
(work by Yinggong Zhao) and AMR to target language generation (Yang Gao).
