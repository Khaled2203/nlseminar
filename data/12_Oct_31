We will given an overview of  the challenges and early results of an EC-funded project,  named MateCat,
whose goal is  developing an enhanced web-based CAT tool integrating new MT functionalities. In particular,
MateCat will investigate the integration of MT into the CAT working process along three main directions: 
self-tuning MT, user adaptive MT, and informative MT.  In this seminar, we will report on recent activities 
concerning domain and on-line MT adaptation and will introduce the first version of the MateCat tool,
that will be officially released in open source by the end of the year.
