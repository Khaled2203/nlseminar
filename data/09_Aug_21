Bilingually-Constrained (Monolingual) Shift-Reduce Parsing

Jointly parsing two languages has been shown to improve accuracies on
either or both sides. However, its search space is much bigger than
the monolingual case, forcing existing approaches to employ
complicated modeling and crude approximations. Here we propose a much
simpler alternative, bilingually-constrained monolingual parsing,
where a source-language parser learns to exploit reorderings as
additional observation, but not bothering to build the target-side
tree as well. We show specifically how to enhance a shift-reduce
dependency parser to use alignment features to resolve shift-reduce
conflicts. Experiments on the bilingual portion of Chinese Treebank
show that, with just 3 bilingual features, we can improve parsing
accuracies by 0.6% for both English and Chinese, with negligible (~6%)
efficiency overhead, thus much faster than biparsing.
