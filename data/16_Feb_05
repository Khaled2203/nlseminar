Facts and their relations extracted from web are commonly modeled as graphs with different types of vertices. In this work, we focus on the problem of revealing latent entities from a $k$-partite graph, by co-clustering $k$ types of different vertices. We propose a CoSum approach, which creates a summary graph, where each super node (a cluster of original vertices) represents a hidden entity and the weighted edges encode important relations among extracted entities. The resulted summary graph also allows for investigation and interpretation of hidden entities. Evaluation verifies that CoSum outperforms several baselines in terms of entity coherence, query supporting and recovering hidden victims in the applied human trafficking domain.
