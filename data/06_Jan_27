A multi-document summary gives the "gist" of what is contained in a
collection of related documents. But how can we define a "gist?" We
explore this question by analyzing human written summaries for clusters of
document sets. In particular, we estimate the probability that word will
be chosen by a human to be included in a summary. We demonstrate that if
this probability model were given by an oracle, then a simple automatic
method of summarization can produce extract summaries which are
statistically indistinguishable from the human summaries.
