This high-level survey will describe the results of statistical machine translation (SMT) research since 1948. Part of the survey will cover the explosion of work in the past few years that has resulted from intense interest on the part of scientists, funders, and industry. We will also examine the roots of SMT in World War II decipherment activities. Some of the concepts from that era have become core to the field, while others still remain to be picked up.
