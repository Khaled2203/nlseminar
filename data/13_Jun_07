Is Decipherment Difficult?
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

Is it possible to learn useful translations from large amounts of
monolingual data to improve machine translation? The intuitive
feeling is that learning a language without bilingual data is at
least "more difficult than learning from example translations". In
this talk, I will present recent results on decipherment: I will show
that the decipherment problem is indeed difficult (NP-hard) and what
approximations to the original problem can be made without hurting
decipherment accuracy much.

Bio:
Having studied Physics and Computer Science at RWTH Aachen University, I'm currently a PhD student at Prof. Ney's Human Language Technology and Pattern Recognition Group in Aachen. I'm particularly interested in applying decipherment techniques to improve machine translation.
