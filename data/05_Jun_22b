(This talk occurs in the morning on the same day as the Bayesian tutorial.)

The goal of our research is to support cooperative work performed by
stakeholders sitting around a table. To support such cooperation, various
table-based systems with a shared electronic display on the tabletop have
been developed. These systems, however, suffer the common problem of not
recognizing shared information such as text and images equally because the
orientation of their view angle is not favorable. To solve this problem,
we propose the Lumisight Table. This is a system capable of displaying
personalized information to each required direction on one horizontal
screen simultaneously by multiplexing them and of capturing stakeholders'
gestures to manipulate the information.
