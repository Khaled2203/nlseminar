Natural language interfaces designed for agents that interact with users
in shared environments (e.g. training simulators, videogames) must
incorporate knowledge about the users' context in order to address the
many ambiguities of situated language use. We introduce a model of
situated language acquisition that operates in two phases.  First,
intentional context is represented and inferred from user actions using
probabilistic context free grammars.  Then, utterances are mapped onto
this representation in a noisy channel framework.  The acquisition model
is trained on unconstrained speech collected from subjects playing an
interactive game, and tested using an understanding task.  Discussion of
results focuses both on the implications for theoretical models of
cognition, as well as, for natural language applications in shared
environments.
