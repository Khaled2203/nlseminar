Talk-1: Learning Phoneme Mappings for Transliteration without Parallel Data

We present a method for performing machine transliteration without any parallel resources. We frame the transliteration task as a decipherment problem and show that it is possible to learn cross-language phoneme mapping tables using only monolingual resources.  We compare various methods and evaluate their accuracies on a standard name transliteration task.

This is joint work with Kevin Knight.

Talk-2: A New Objective Function for Word Alignment

We develop a new objective function for word alignment that measures the size of the bilingual dictionary induced by an alignment. A word alignment that results in a small dictionary is preferred over one that results in a large dictionary.  In order to search for the alignment that minimizes this objective, we cast the problem as one of integer linear programming.  We then extend our objective function to align corpora at the sub-word level, which we demonstrate on a small Turkish-English corpus.

This is joint work with Tugba Bodrumlu and Kevin Knight.
