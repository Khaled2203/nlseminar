Understanding the World's Compositional Concepts

Compositional topics ("Swiss passport", "German grammar") of
interest to Web users may be available as entries within structured
knowledge resources. But such topics are not necessarily connected to,
let alone represented in relation to, entries of the constituent
topics ("Switzerland" and "Passport", or "German language" and
"Grammar") from which their approximate meaning could be aggregated.
Web documents - more precisely, encyclopedic articles - and Web search
queries are shown to be useful in complementary tasks relevant to
understanding compositional topics. The tasks are the decomposition of
potentially compositional topics into zero, one or more constituent
topics; and the interpretation of the role ("issued by", "of") played
by constituents ("Swiss", "German") within ambiguous compositional
phrases that might refer to compositional topics.

Bio: Marius Pasca is a research scientist at Google in Mountain View,
California. Current research interests include factual information
extraction from unstructured text within documents and queries, and
its applications to Web search.
