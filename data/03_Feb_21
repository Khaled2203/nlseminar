Statistical Language Generation in a Dialogue System
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm

The large corpora of written text that is available to the language
community has largely been utilized for language understanding; it has
somewhat been ignored in the context of language generation. Recent
developments in stochastic generation have allowed such systems to shift
the burden from hand crafted databases (lexicons, grammars, ontologies) to
the knowledge implicitly found in written text. However, when building a
dialogue system, generation is largely interactive, very different from
the written structure of most corpora.

In this talk, I will discuss my recent work at applying a stochastic
generator, HALogen, and its newswire language model to a dialogue system,
TRIPS. I'll describe the difficulties in mapping the TRIPS semantic form
into HALogen's representation, the critical differences between newswire
and dialogue, and the possibility of using HALogen and a large newswire
model as a domain independent generator.
