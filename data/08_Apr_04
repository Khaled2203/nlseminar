We present a method to transliterate names in the framework of
end-to-end statistical machine translation. The system is trained to
learn when to transliterate.

For Arabic to English MT, we developed and trained a transliterator on a
bitext of 7 million sentences and Google's English terabyte ngrams and
achieved better name translation accuracy than 3 out of 4 professional
translators. The talk also includes a discussion of challenges in name
translation evaluation.
