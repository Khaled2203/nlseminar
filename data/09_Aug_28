Tree-to-String Alignment Models

Machine translation systems typically rely on some form alignment as a
preprocessing step. Typically, these alignments take the form of
word-to-word alignments. In this talk, we will introduce several
models aimed at aligning foreign words to either English words or
nodes in the English parse tree. Such word-to-node alignments offer
several potential advantages over traditional word-to-word
alignments. Firstly, since the extraction process for some syntactic
systems explicitly considers the English trees, we expect that also
considering the trees at alignment time will produce alignments that
will better suit the extraction process. Secondly, aligning foreign
function words to English tree nodes can admits highly desirable
syntactic transfer rules which cannot be directly as word-to-word
alignments. Finally, word-to-node alignments can effectively model
many-to-one alignments.  We present four models of increasing
complexity and show preliminary results for each model.
