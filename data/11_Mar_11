Nonparametric Bayesian Models for Clustering Feature-Rich Linguistic Objects
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

In this talk, I will present how a new class of unsupervised,
nonparametric Bayesian models can be effectively applied to solve real data applications that involve clustering feature-rich linguistic objects.

First, I will describe a generalization of the hierarchical Dirichlet
process model to account for additional properties associated with
observable objects. In addition, to overcome some of the limitations of
this new model, I will then describe a new hybrid model which combines
an infinite latent class model with a discrete time series model. The
main advantages of this hybrid model are the abilities to represent
a potentially infinite number of features associated with observable
objects and to perform an automatic selection of the most salient
features.  Furthermore, all the models described in this talk are
designed to account for a potential number of categorical outcomes. 
The evaluation performed for solving both within- and cross document
event coreference shows significant improvements of the models when
compared against three baselines for this task.
