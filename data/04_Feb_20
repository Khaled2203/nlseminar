I will be presenting some recent results of mine regarding the possibility
of automatic evaluation in summarization.  I will discuss both my own 
findings, as well of those of people here and at Columbia, and attempt to 
explain in a principled fashion why there are disparate opinions on the 
plausibility of performing automatic evaluation in this task.  I will
discuss my (perhaps pessimistic) views on the plausibility of doing any
sort of evaluation of summarization, automatic or otherwise.

The results and experimental setups developed in connection with 
summarization will be extended to the machine translation.  I will review 
possible reasons why metrics such a bleu have experienced significantly 
more success in machine translation than in summarization.  I will also 
connect the evaluation criterea developed in the context of summarization 
to machine translation, and discuss the automation of these methods.

In short: I'll talk about why I've been doing so much data elicitaiton 
recently.

This will be a highly informal seminar and participation is highly
encouraged.
