Because natural language is complex, researchers in many domains look for lower-dimensional representations of text to suit their purposes. Different methods attempt to single out intuitive aspects of language like content, sentiment, or style. I will discuss a new, unsupervised approach to learning abstract representations of text (or other high-dimensional signals). The motivating principle is to use information theory to construct higher-order features that explain correlations between lower-order features. I will present preliminary results using this framework.

Greg Ver Steeg is a research professor at ISI. His research explores practical methods for inferring meaningful structure in complex systems like social networks. He did his PhD in quantum physics at Caltech.
