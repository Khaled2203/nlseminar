We show that phrase structures in Penn Treebank style parses
are not optimal for syntax-based machine translation. We
exploit a series of binarization methods to restructure the
Peen Treebank style trees such that syntactified phrases
smaller than Penn Treebank constituents can be acquired and
exploited in translation. We find that by employing the EM
algorithm for determining the binarization of a parse tree
among a set of alternative binarizations gives us the best
translation result.
