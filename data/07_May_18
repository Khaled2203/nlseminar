Computing Semantic Similarity between Skill Statements for Approximate Matching

(This will be an extended version of the talk for NAACL-HLT 2007. It's
based on my summer internship work at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center
last year.) 

The project aimed to address the problems encountered when trying to
match available employees to open job positions, based on skill
matches. Currently, job search applications, like IBM's Professional
Marketplace, only find exact matches. A skill affinity computation is
desired to allow searches to be expanded to related/similar skills,
and return more potential matches. 

In this talk, I will explore the problem of computing text similarity
between verb phrases describing skilled human behavior for the purpose
of finding approximate matches. Four parsers (Charniak's parser,
Stanford's parser, IBM XSG slot grammar parser, and Lin's MINIPAR) are
evaluated on a corpus of skill statements extracted from an
enterprise-wide expertise taxonomy. A similarity measure utilizing
common semantic role features extracted from parse trees was found
superior to an information-theoretic measure of similarity and
comparable to the level of human agreement.
