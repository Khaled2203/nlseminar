Notes on the Constraint Composite Graph
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
6th Floor Large Conference Room [689]

In this talk, I will present the idea of the constraint composite graph (CCG) associated with any combinatorial problem modeled as a weighted constraint satisfaction problem (WCSP). The CCG constitutes the first mathematical framework for simultaneously exploiting the numerical structure of the weighted constraints as well as the graphical structure of the variable-interactions in a WCSP. I will discuss a number of important applications of the CCG including its role in: (a) identification of tractable classes of WCSPs; (b) kernelization techniques for combinatorial problems; and (c) understanding the scope of incremental computation for hard combinatorial problems.

Bio. Dr. Satish Kumar Thittamaranahalli (T. K. Satish Kumar) is a Research Scientist at the University of Southern California. He has published extensively on numerous topics in Artificial Intelligence spanning such diverse areas as Constraint Reasoning, Planning and Scheduling, Probabilistic Reasoning, Combinatorial Optimization, Approximation and Randomization, Heuristic Search, Model-Based Reasoning, Knowledge Representation and Spatio-Temporal Reasoning. He has served on the Program Committees of many international conferences in Artificial Intelligence and is a co-winner of the Best Student Paper Award from the 2005 International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling. Dr. Kumar received his PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University in March 2005. In the past, he has also been a Visiting Student at the NASA Ames Research Center, a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, a Research Scientist at the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of West Florida, and a Senior Research and Development Scientist at Mission Critical Technologies.
