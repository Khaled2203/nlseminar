Steven Bird (University of Melbourne)
The Human Language Project: Building a Universal Corpus of the World's Languages
3:30 pm - 4:30 pm
10th Floor Conference Room 

We present a grand challenge to build a corpus that will include all of the world's languages, in a consistent structure that permits large-scale cross-linguistic processing, enabling the study of universal linguistics.  The focal data types, bilingual texts and lexicons, relate each language to one of a set of reference languages. We propose that the ability to train systems to translate into and out of a given language be the yardstick for determining when we have successfully captured a language.  We call on the computational linguistics community to begin work on this Universal Corpus, pursuing the many strands of activity described here, as their contribution to the global effort to document the world's linguistic heritage before more languages fall silent.
 

(This talk will present joint work with Steve Abney.)


Brief Bio:

Steven Bird is Associate Professor in the Department of Computer
Science and Software Engineering at the University of Melbourne, and
also Senior Research Associate at the Linguistic Data Consortium.  In
2009 he served as president of the Association for Computational
Linguistics, and he completed a textbook on Natural Language
Processing, published by O'Reilly.  Steven studies scalable,
semi-automatic methods for analyzing spoken and written language, and
for preserving endangered languages. This involves a mixture of
computational modelling and linguistic fieldwork.  For further details
