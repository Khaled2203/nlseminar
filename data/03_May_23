1) A serious bottleneck in the development of trainable text summarization
systems is the shortage of training data. Constructing such data is a very
tedious task, especially because there are in general many different
correct ways to summarize a text. Fortunately we can utilize the Internet
as a source of suitable training data. In this paper, we present a
summarization system that uses the web as the source of training data. The
procedure involves structuring the articles downloaded from various
websites, building adequate corpora of (summary, text) and (extract,
text) pairs, training on positive and negative data, and automatically
learning to perform the task of extraction-based summarization systems.

2) Headlines are useful for users who only need information on the main
topics of a story. We present a headline summarization system that is
built at ISI for this purpose and is a top performer for DUC2003's task 1,
generating very short summaries (10 words or less).
