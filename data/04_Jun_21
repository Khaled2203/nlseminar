Speech-to-Speech Translation: A Phrase Classification Approach

This talk will be about automatic speech-to-speech translation.  In our
system, a doctor speaks one language, the patient speaks another language,
and the machine translates their utterances from one language to the
other.  The talk will be followed by a demo of our system.

One approach we have been successful with is phrase classification, i.e.,
classifying a noisy speech-recognized utterance into one of many meaning
categories.  Phrase classification is computationally cheap and can
provide high quality translations for in domain utterances almost
instantaneously. Speed is important for speech translation, where
processing delay is a great concern.

In this talk, different aspects of building a classification-based speech
translator are discussed. Following an overview of automatic
speech-to-speech translation and its challenges, a comparison of different
classification methods is presented and data collection techniques for
that application are introduced.
