Combining Constituent Parsers (Victoria Fossum: 3:00pm -- 3:30pm)

Combining the 1-best output of multiple parsers via parse selection or
parse hybridization improves f-score over the best individual parser
(Henderson and Brill, 1999; Sagae and Lavie, 2006). We propose three ways to improve upon existing methods for parser combination.

Disambiguation of Preposition Sense Using Linguistically Motivated
Features (Dirk Hovy: 3:30pm -- 4:00pm)

Classifying polysemous words into their proper sense classes is
potentially useful to any NLP application that needs to extract
information from text or build a semantic representation of the
textual information. Like instances of other word classes, many
prepositions are ambiguous, carrying different semantic meanings
(including notions of instrumental, accompaniment, location, etc.)
In this paper, we present a supervised classification approach for
disambiguation of preposition senses. We use the SemEval 2007
Preposition Sense Disambiguation datasets to evaluate our system and
compare its results to those of the systems participating in the
workshop. We derived linguistically motivated features from both sides
of the preposition. Instead of restricting     these to a fixed window
size, we utilized the phrase structure. Testing with five different
classifiers, we can report an increased accuracy (76.4%) that
outperforms the best system in the SemEval task.
