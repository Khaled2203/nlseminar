In this talk, I will present my current work on language understanding
in the project, Mission Rehearsal Exercise(MRE). One of the challenges
in a dialogure system is to provide a robust understanding/parsing
compoment. We applied both Finte State Model and Statistical Learning
Model for the parsing of separate sentences of dialogue utterances.
Their performances are evaluated and compared with a new blind set.
And we hope to incorporate them to make a better solution in this
specific application.
