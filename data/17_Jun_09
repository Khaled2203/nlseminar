Introduction to Graph Signal Processing: Tools for Harmonic Analysis on Irregular Structures.
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
6th Floor  Conference Room [689]

During the past few years, graph signal processing has been extending the field
of signal processing on Euclidean spaces to irregular spaces represented by
graphs. We have seen successes ranging from the Fourier transform, to
wavelets, vertex-frequency (time-frequency) decomposition, sampling theory,
uncertainty principle, or convolutive filtering. This presentation introduces
the field, the type of signals involved, and how harmonic analysis is
performed.

Bio: Benjamin Girault received his License (B.Sc.) and his Master (M.Sc.) in France
from École Normale Supérieure de Cachan, France, in 2009 and 2012 respectively
in the field of theoretical computer science. He then received his PhD in
computer science from École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, France, in December
2015. His dissertation entitled "Signal Processing on Graphs - Contributions
to an Emerging Field" focuses on extending the classical definition of
stationary temporal signals to stationary graph signal. Currently, he is a
postdoctoral scholar with Professors Antonio Ortega and Shri Narayanan at the
University of Southern California continuing his work on graph signal
processing with a focus on applying these tools to understanding human
behavior.
