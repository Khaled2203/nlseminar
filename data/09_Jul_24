K-Best A* Parsing (Adam Pauls)

A* parsing makes 1-best search efficient by
suppressing unlikely 1-best items. Existing k-
best extraction methods can efficiently search
for top derivations, but only after an exhaus-
tive 1-best pass. We present a unified algo-
rithm for k-best A* parsing which preserves
the efficiency of k-best extraction while giv-
ing the speed-ups of A* methods. Our algo-
rithm produces optimal k-best parses under the
same conditions required for optimality in a
1-best A* parser. Empirically, optimal k-best
lists can be extracted significantly faster than
with other approaches, over a range of gram-
mar types.

Improved Word Alignment with Statistics and Linguistic Heuristics (Ulf Hermjakob)

We present a method to align words in a bitext that combines elements
of a traditional statistical approach with linguistic knowledge.
We demonstrate this approach for Arabic-English, using an alignment
lexicon produced by a statistical word aligner, as well as linguistic
resources ranging from an English parser to heuristic alignment rules
for function words. These linguistic heuristics have been generalized
from a development corpus of 100 parallel sentences.
Our aligner, UALIGN, outperforms both the commonly used GIZA++ aligner
and the state-of-the-art LEAF aligner on F-measure and produces
superior scores in end-to-end statistical machine translation,
+1.3 BLEU points over GIZA++, and +0.7 over LEAF.
