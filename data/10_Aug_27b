Yoav Goldberg
Intern Final Talk: Small is beautiful. Is it any good?
3:30 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

This talk summarizes our experience with searching for small models
for syntax-based machine translation.  I will first present cases
suggesting that smaller models are desirable, and present some
evidence that minimizing model size is a reasonable objective
function.  I will then show cases where this objective may be too
aggressive.
