How to Speak a Language Without Knowing It
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

We develop a system that lets people overcome language barriers by letting them speak a language they do not know.  Our system accepts text entered by a user, translates the text, then converts the translation into a phonetic spelling in the userâ€™s own orthography. We trained the system on phonetic spellings in travel phrasebooks.

Xing Shi is a PhD student at USC, advised by Professor Kevin Knight.
