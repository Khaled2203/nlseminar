Title: The TechKnAcq Project: Building Pedagogically Tuned Reading Lists from Technical Corpora
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

Abstract: This work is geared towards developing pedagogically-tuned information retrieval systems to help learners select the most informative documents as a reading list for a given query over a given technical corpus. This work will enable learners to understand complex subjects more quickly. I will discuss our overall methodology, our efforts to study dependency between topics within a technical corpus and improvements to evaluating topic quality. I will describe ongoing efforts to study a document's pedagogical value to the end user and future directions for this enterprise.
