Weighted Alignment Matrices for Statistical Machine Translation

Current statistical machine translation systems usually
extract rules from bilingual
corpora annotated with 1-best alignments. They are prone to learn
noisy rules due to alignment mistakes. We propose a new structure
called weighted alignment matrix
to encode all possible alignments for a parallel text compactly. The
key idea is to assign a probability to each word pair to indicate how
well they are aligned. We design new algorithms for extracting phrase
pairs from weighted alignment matrices and estimating their
probabilities. Our experiments on multiple language pairs show that
using weighted matrices achieves consistent improvements over using
n-best lists in significant less extraction time.

Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences. He received his PhD
degree in Computer Science from ICT in 2007. His major research
interests include statistical machine translation and Chinese
information processing. He has been working on syntax-based modeling,
word alignment, and system combination. His paper on tree-to-string
translation won the Meritorious Asian NLP Paper Award of COLING/ACL
