Learning and Reading
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

In recent years, a dramatic increase in the availability of digital text has created challenges and opportunities for learning for both humans and machines. My talk will describe research on learning commonsense knowledge from text -- despite our Gricean imperative to write down only what other people wouldn't know -- and using this for reasoning about language and the world. It will also address helping people to learn scientific knowledge by using implicit structure in a proliferation of articles, books, online courses, and other educational resources.

Bio: Jonathan Gordon is a postdoctoral researcher at the USC Information Sciences Institute, where he works with Jerry Hobbs and colleagues on the problems of learning and organizing knowledge from text. He completed a bachelor's degree in computer science at Vassar College and a Ph.D. in artificial intelligence at the University of Rochester, supervised by Lenhart Schubert.
