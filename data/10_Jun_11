Easy First Dependency Parsing and How Different Parsers Behave Differently
3:30 pm - 4:30 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

I will present a new kind of dependency parsing algorithm: easy first,
non directional dependency parsing.  This is a greedy, bottom up
parser, admitting an efficient O(nlogn) implementation.  Unlike
shift-reduce based greedy parsers, it does not analyze the sentence in
a fixed sequential order, but instead tries to make easier attachment
decisions between harder ones.  The parser performs well on both
Hebrew and English.  I also present evidence that the parsers produces
qualitatively different parses than either the Malt or the MST
parsers.  This observation give rise to an intriguing questions: why
do different parsers produce different parses? can we quantify this
kind of difference?  In the second part of the talk I will present my
attempts to answer these kinds of questions.
