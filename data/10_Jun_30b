Weighted tree transducers have been proposed as useful formal models for representing syntactic natural language pro- cessing applications, but there has been little description of inference algorithms for these automata beyond formal foundations. We give a detailed description of algorithms for application of cascades of weighted tree transducers to weighted tree acceptors, connecting formal theory with actual practice. Additionally, we present novel on-the-fly variants of these algorithms, and compare their performance on a syntax machine translation cascade based on (Yamada and Knight, 2001).
