I will describe some recent work on "natural logics", logics for languages
that are more similar to human languages than traditional first order
predicate logic, giving particular attention to questions about what the
syntax encodes about semantic relations among sentences. On everyone's
view, some but not all entailments are syntactically encoded (in a sense
that I will define precisely), but, beyond this starting point,
controversy starts almost immediately. Considering some particular
examples, I will sketch methods for addressing some of the basic
questions.
