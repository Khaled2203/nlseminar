EMNLP practice talk: Understanding Neural Machine Translation: length control and syntactic structure
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
6th Floor Large Conference Room [689]

Neural Machine Translation is powerful but we know little about the black box. We conduct the following two investigations to gain a better understanding: First, we investigate how neural, encoder-decoder translation systems output target strings of appropriate lengths, finding that a collection of hidden units learns to explicitly implement this functionality. Second, we investigate whether a neural, encoderdecoder translation system learns syntactic information on the source side as a by-product of training. We propose two methods to detect whether the encoder has learned local and global source syntax. A fine-grained analysis of the syntactic structure learned by the encoder reveals which kinds of syntax are learned and which are missing.
