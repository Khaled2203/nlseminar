A major hurdle in building automated information retrieval systems for
Hindi text is the lack of an uniform encoding for text representation.
Standards do exist, but noone seems interested. Every web content
publisher seems to have their encoding system, making information
extraction a nightmare. We explore an unsupervised approach to
convert any given "unknown" encoding to UTF-8, by treating it as a
decipherment problem. We also study how a little amount of supervision
can improve decoding accuracy.
