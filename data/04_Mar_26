On Writing, Our Selves: Explorations in Stylistic Text Categorization
1:30 pm - 3:00 pm
11 Large

This talk will survey results of several recent projects we have been
undertaking in automated text categorization based upon the style,
rather than the topic, of the documents.  I will describe a general
text-categorization framework using machine learning along with general
principles for choosing stylistically relevant sets of features for
learning effective classification models.  Applications of these methods
include determining author gender and text genre in published books and
articles, authorship attribution of email messages, and analysis of
language use in different scientific fields.  In many cases, the models
that are learned also give some insight into the respective styles being
distinguished, which I will also discuss.
