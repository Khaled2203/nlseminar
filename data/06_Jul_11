Extracting Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments from Non-Parallel Corpora
Dragos Munteanu

We present a novel method for extracting parallel sub-sentential fragments
from comparable bilingual corpora. Currently, the state of the art in
comparable corpus mining is only able to extract full sentence pairs which
are judged to be parallel. We advance the state of the art by showing how
to obtain useful data even from not-fully-parallel sentences. By analyzing
sentence pairs using a signal-processing-inspired approach, we detect
which segments of the source sentence are translated into segments of the
target sentence, and which are not. We evaluate the quality of the
extracted data by showing that it improves the performance of a
state-of-othe-art machine translation system.


Advances in Discriminative Parsing
Joseph Turian

The present work advances the accuracy and training speed of
discriminative parsing. Our discriminative parsing method has no
generative component, yet surpasses a generative baseline on constituent
parsing, and does so with minimal linguistic cleverness. Our model can
incorporate arbitrary features of the input and parse state, and performs
feature selection incrementally over an exponential feature space during
training. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by testing it
with several parsing strategies and various feature sets.
