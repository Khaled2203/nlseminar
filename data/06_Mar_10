Exploring the Potential of Intractable Parsers
3:00 pm - 4:30 pm
10th Floor

We revisit the idea of history-based parsing, and present a history-based
parsing framework that strives to be simple, general, and flexible.  We
also provide a decoder for this probability model that is linear-space,
optimal, and anytime.  A parser based on this framework, when evaluated on
Section 23 of the Penn Treebank, compares favorably with other
state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of both accuracy and speed.
