Professor Snyder,

On behalf of the natural language processing group at ISI, I would like to ask whether you are intersted in giving a talk at our NL seminar. 

The seminar has a long history of bringing bright researchers and their cool work to ISI. You can browse past and upcoming talks at our seminar's website : http://nlg.isi.edu/nl-seminar/. The talks usually happen at 3pm on Fridays, and last for an hour, including questions.

I know that you are visiting ISI in June. Will you be able to give a talk on June 21st or 28th? Please let me know.

Best,
Qing Dou

Dear Dr./Professor BLANK,

I'm a PhD student at the University of Southern California, working with Professor Kevin Knight in the Natural Language Group at the Information Sciences Institute. I'm also the organizer of ISI's Natural Language Seminar (http://nlg.isi.edu/nl-seminar/), a weekly talk at ISI.

I saw that you had subscribed to our mailing list and looked you up, since I'm currently looking for good speakers for next semester (February and on). Would you be interested in speaking?
OR
I'm currently looking for good speakers for the next semester (January and on), and recent speaker Boris Gutman at LONI suggested that you'd be a good person to contact. Would you be interested in speaking?
OR
I read your paper on affective language model adaptation at ICASSP, and I thought it was really interesting!
Would you be interested in coming to speak about that (or any other research problem that you're working on) at the NL seminar?

Speakers give ~1 hour long talks, usually about recently published or ongoing research, or overviews of a topic/research area. A talk at ISI would be a great way to introduce your company and work to the ISI community and meet some of the great faculty, researchers, and students we have here.

Speakers usually talk about recently published or ongoing research, or give overviews of a topic/research area. I should also note that, although the title is the "Natural Language" Seminar and the attendees are mainly people from the Natural Language group, we enjoy learning about new problems and thinking about interdisciplinary approaches. <--this is for people who might protest that they're not "Natural Language" people.

[Optional, or to be included later...]
I can schedule you very far in advance; right now the earliest opening we have is Friday, February 13. (NL seminars are usually Fridays from 3-4 PM.)  I'm happy to accommodate your schedule and I can schedule you even farther in advance if necessary.

Please let me know if you'd be interested in speaking, or if you have any questions.

Thanks very much,
Aliya
