Professor Snyder,

On behalf of the natural language processing group at ISI, I would like to ask whether you are intersted in giving a talk at our NL seminar. 

The seminar has a long history of bringing bright researchers and their cool work to ISI. You can browse past and upcoming talks at our seminar's website : http://nlg.isi.edu/nl-seminar/. The talks usually happen at 3pm on Fridays, and last for an hour, including questions.

I know that you are visiting ISI in June. Will you be able to give a talk on June 21st or 28th? Please let me know.

Best,
Qing Dou
